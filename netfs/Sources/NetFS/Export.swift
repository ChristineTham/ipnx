//
//  Export.swift -- one exported host directory, seen through 1985 eyes.
//
//  This is where the impedance mismatch lives. The protocol is a thin thing;
//  the hard part is that the client is a kernel with 16-bit inode numbers,
//  14-byte filenames and no notion of a directory read that isn't just
//  read(2) on a file. Four consequences drive everything below.
//
//  1. INODE NUMBERS ARE SYNTHETIC, AND HAVE TO BE. `usr/sys/h/types.h` has
//     `typedef u_short ino_t`, and `struct direct` is a 2-byte ino plus a
//     14-byte name. APFS hands out 64-bit inode numbers as a matter of course.
//     So the server keeps its own 1...65535 namespace and a host(dev,ino) ->
//     ours map, which also gives us the stability the client's inode cache
//     needs: the same host file must always come back as the same number, or
//     the guest ends up with two inodes for one file.
//
//  2. THE EXPORT ROOT IS ALWAYS INODE 2. Not a choice. `iget()` crosses a
//     mount by setting `ino = ROOTINO` and re-looking-up, so the client's very
//     first request on a fresh mount is NGET(dev, 2) and there is no other way
//     to name the root.
//
//  3. DIRECTORIES ARE SYNTHESISED. There is no readdir opcode -- `ls` opens a
//     directory and read(2)s 16-byte records out of it, which arrives here as
//     an ordinary NREAD. macOS will not let you read(2) a directory at all, so
//     the server builds the V8-format image itself and caches it on the handle,
//     which also keeps the size reported by NGET/NSTAT consistent with what a
//     subsequent NREAD returns even if the host directory changes underneath.
//
//  4. NAMES ARE TRUNCATED TO 14 BYTES, in the listing *and* in lookup. A
//     component arriving in NNAMI is matched against each child's truncated
//     name, so a file the guest can see is a file the guest can open. Two
//     children that truncate alike are a genuine collision; first match wins
//     and it is logged.
//
