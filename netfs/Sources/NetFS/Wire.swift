//  running V8 by tools/v8-netfs-probe.exp rather than inferred from the struct
//  declaration; both structures contain hand-written `rsvd` padding plus one
//  hole each that 1985 VAX pcc inserted on its own, and guessing where a
//  compiler puts a hole is exactly the kind of assumption that has already been
//  wrong once in this project.
//
//  The VAX-11/780 is little-endian, which is the one mercy here: an Apple
//  Silicon host and a VAX agree about byte order, so every field is a straight
//  copy and there is no marshalling anywhere in this file beyond bounds
//  checking.

// if this file names the module, because `Darwin.ENOENT' does not exist on
// Linux and that single qualification is what kept the package Mac-only.
// Server.swift and Export.swift have carried this guard since they were
// written; Wire.swift was the one file that did not.

// so the switch would compare a host errno against the wrong namespace and
// silently answer wrongly.  The original said `Darwin.ENOENT' to escape that.
// Out here there is no V8Errno to shadow anything, so the plain name IS the
