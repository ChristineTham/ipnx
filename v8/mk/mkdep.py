Generate the makefiles Research Unix never had.

    v8/mk/mkdep.py            # regenerate v8/mk/gen/*.mk
    v8/mk/mkdep.py --check    # fail if the committed output is stale

V8's make is V7's make: suffix rules, macros, `include` (yes, really -- see
gram.y's isinclude()), and command-line macro assignment. What it does not have
is any way to discover that foo.o depends on a header three includes deep. It
compares mtimes against an explicit prerequisite list and nothing more.

So the list is written for it, here, on the host, and committed. That is not a
modern imposition on a 1985 system: it is exactly what V8 already does for the
kernel, where config(8) reads conf/files and writes the makefile. This does for
userland what Bell Labs did for the kernel.

WHAT EACH RULE DEPENDS ON

The point of generating rather than hand-writing is that the dependencies which
actually invalidate a target can be stated in full:

    every .o   ->  its .c, every header it reaches transitively,
                   and $(CC) $(CCOM) $(CPP) $(C2) $(AS)
    every bin  ->  its .o files, $(LD), and $(LIBC)
    yacc out   ->  its .y and $(YACC)
    lex out    ->  its .l and $(LEX)

Changing the compiler therefore rebuilds the world, changing yacc rebuilds the
compiler and then the world, and changing libc relinks everything -- which is
the real dependency structure of a self-hosting system, and the reason a plain
loop over directories quietly produces a system built by two different
compilers.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT GENERATED

An `install` target that writes into `/`. The tape's own makefiles do -- the
worst is ccom's, which is

    install: comp
            cp /lib/ccom comp.sv
            cp comp /lib/ccom

i.e. it overwrites the compiler you are compiling with. Our makefiles install
into $(TOOLDIR) or $(DESTDIR) and nowhere else; see docs/build-from-source.md.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------ libc

# libc is not another entry in STAGE1: it is an archive, not a program, and
# almost every step of the tape's recipe is a special case.  Generating it
# separately is honest about that.
#
# usr/src/libc/Makefile builds it as
#
#	cc -c -O crt/*.s gen/*.[cs] math/*.c stdio/*.c sys/*.s
#	rm errlst.o; make errlst.o          # compile to .s, ed it, assemble

#	ar cr libc.a `lorder *.o | tsort`
#	ar ma flsbuf.o libc.a exit.o
#	ar m libc.a cleanup.o
#
# Four of those are not derivable and must be carried across verbatim:
#
#   errlst.c is compiled to assembly and then EDITED -- gen/:errfix moves the
#   error-message table from .data to .text so it lands in shared text.
#
#   doprnt.S is assembly that needs the C preprocessor first, which cc will not
#   do for a .s file, so it is renamed to .c to get -E and piped to as.
#
#   `ld -x -r` on every object strips local symbols and re-emits it relocatable.
#   Skipping it does not fail the build; it inflates every binary that links
#   libc and pollutes the symbol table.
#
#   `lorder | tsort` orders the archive members, and the two `ar m` calls fix
#   up what the topological sort cannot know.  V8's ld is SINGLE PASS: it walks

# Headers.
#
# Nothing is compiled here; the whole stage is 224 copies.  It exists as its
# own stage because everything after it must compile against OUR headers
# rather than the running system's, and that is a property of the -I that
# stages 5, 6 and 7 use, not of anything they do.
#
# Rules per file, not one bulk copy, so that touching a header reinstalls it
# and everything that includes it rebuilds.  That is the dependency rule the
# whole build is organised around, and headers are where it bites hardest --
# one line in <sys/param.h> invalidates the kernel and most of userland.
#
# The prerequisite lists are grouped by directory and split at 50 files.
# V8's make reads a line into INMAX = 5000 bytes (cmd/make/defs) and expands
# a target's prerequisites into tgsbuf[QBUFMAX], also 5000.  All 224 paths on
# one line is about 7,800 characters, which overflows both.  Grouped, the
# largest expansion is under 1,900.

    directory is not enough to answer that: /bin/bls is a Bell Labs binary
    with no tape entry that happens to live in a directory this build also
    installs into, and treating "in a destdir and not on the tape" as "ours"
    silently dropped it from the disk.

    THESE TWO LISTS USED TO SHARE destdirs.txt, the paths distinguished from

    builddisk.sh reads the file as

            for d in `grep -v '^#' .../destdirs.txt`

    and the shell splits on IFS, which contains tab. So every one of the 458
    installed paths arrived at `mkdir' indistinguishable from a directory,
    and stage 8 created /bin/adb, /bin/cc, /etc/init and 95 more as empty
    DIRECTORIES. The copy pass then skipped each of them -- it is guarded by
    `test -d $DEST/$d', which is false for a file -- so the disk came out
    with the built half of /bin and /etc missing and the carried half
    intact. It mounted, it fscked, it walked, and it could not boot: the
    kernel loaded, autoconfig finished, and there was no /etc/init to exec.

    The general lesson is worth more than the case. A distinction encoded in

# ================================================================ stage 5
# The libraries.
#
# libc is stage 2 and is not here: it is needed to build the toolchain, so it
# cannot wait for one.  These are everything else, and every one of them is
# an archive built the same way -- compile, ar, ranlib -- with the per-library
# facts taken from the tape's own makefile and recorded in `note`.
#
# NO lorder | tsort HERE, and the reason is worth writing down because the
# opposite is recorded elsewhere in this project.  V8's ld is only single-pass
# for an archive with no usable table of contents.  ld.c's getfile() returns
# 1 (no __.SYMDEF), 2 (current) or 3 (stale, because the archive's mtime is
# newer); case 2 runs `while (ldrand()) continue;` -- repeated passes -- under
# a comment that says "you can get away with backward references when there
# is a table of contents!".  Cases 1 and 3 fall back to one sequential pass
# AND print a warning naming ranlib.  So member order is correctness only
# when the table is missing or stale, and ld says so on stderr when it is.
#
# What this does mean: every rule that COPIES an archive must re-ranlib it at
# the destination, because cp updates the mtime and that alone turns a good
# table of contents into case 3.  libc's install already did this and it was
# not obvious why.

# ------------------------------------------------- the rest of usr/src/cmd
#
# Everything above is hand-written because something about it is NOT the
# common case: config needs yacc, lex and a header that exists only in the
# object directory; sh compiles one object to assembly and edits it; and the
# boot path had to be right before stage 8 could exist at all.
#
# The common case is one source file, one binary, one directory to put it in,
# and 173 of those sit LOOSE in usr/src/cmd with no makefile of any kind.
# Those are derived below rather than typed. Not to save typing: 130 hand-
# copied near-identical dicts invite exactly one kind of bug -- a duplicated
# line not fully edited -- and they would bury the single fact that actually
# varies between them, which is where the binary goes.
#
# And that fact is not in the source at all. /usr is a separate filesystem, so
# /bin has to be self-sufficient for a single-user boot, and nothing in a
# loose .c says which of /bin and /usr/bin it belongs to. where.txt answers it
# by MEASUREMENT -- tools/harvest-paths.sh walks the shipped image -- which is
# also why a name the image does not have is skipped rather than guessed: the
# 37 of those are drivers for hardware we do not emulate (rp07dump, bad144,
# hp), terminal support for terminals we do not have (2621, 300, 4014, 450),
# and a handful the image simply never installed.

# (math.h, and not on the image anyway) and nmount.c (ours, hand-written

# --------------------------------------------- the makefile directories
#
# 113 of them, and the reason stage 6 is a list rather than a loop is that they
# are not a family: awk's makefile opens by saying it is wrong, sed links with
# `cc -o sed -n *.o', troff builds two programs out of overlapping object sets.
# So this does NOT try to run them, or to translate them wholesale. It reads
# each one for the two facts we cannot get anywhere else -- which objects, and
# which extra libraries -- and takes everything else from the tree and from
# where.txt, exactly as the loose files do.
#
# It is deliberately narrow, and refuses in four cases rather than guessing:
#
#   * the directory name is not a binary on the image (21 of them). The product
#     is then something else -- learn/ links `a.out', dump/ is not installed at
#     all -- and picking it out of `-o' arguments is guessing.
#   * the makefile runs yacc or lex (21). Those need gen/sidegen rules and an
#     -I., which config(8) already demonstrates; they are worth doing properly
#     rather than pattern-matching.
#   * it names a library with no source in this tree: ether, chaos, y, ln.
#   * it wants more than one product.
#
# What is left is 67 directories that really are "these objects, one binary,
# one place to put it", which is the same shape emit() already handles.

# -l<name> -> the archive stage 5 installs, BY PATH. Never -l: V8's ld has no
# -L, so -ll finds the running system's /usr/lib/libl.a in preference to ours,
# silently.  An empty string means "already in libc, link nothing":
#   m   -- V8 has no libm source at all. usr/src/libc/Makefile does
#          `cc -c -O math/*.c' straight into libc.a and our libc.mk compiles
#          the same 17 files, so -lm is a no-op here. /usr/lib/libm.a exists on
#          the shipped image and is not built from this tree.

#     sh and -- via stage 1 -- the toolchain's own). Each has to be read once,
#     because they are not a family: awk's makefile says outright that it is
#     wrong, sed links with `cc -o sed -n *.o', and troff builds two programs
#     out of overlapping object sets.
#   the 7 directories with no makefile: Admin ccom cref inet lfactor pcc1 upas
#     -- ccom and pcc1 are compilers we already build from elsewhere
#   whatever gen/stage6-skipped.txt lists after the last run
