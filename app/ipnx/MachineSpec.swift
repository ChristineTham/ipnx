/// WHY THIS EXISTS. `Machine` had `v8` written into it in eight places: the
/// Application Support subdirectory, the working disk's name, the pending
/// disk's, the bundled `.disk` and `.disk.id` resources, the boot ROM, and the
/// two SIMH configs. Adding the Tenth Edition beside it meant finding all of
/// them first, which is archaeology rather than engineering — and the project's
/// own experience is that a list of the same thing written twice disagrees
/// silently. Now there is one list.
///
/// **V10 IS A DIFFERENT MACHINE, NOT A DIFFERENT FILENAME.** It boots off an
/// **RA73 on `rq0`** through an MSCP/UDA50A, where V8 uses an **RP07 on `rp0`**
/// on the Massbus; and it is started by **`run FA02`** — the entry point of the
/// tape's own boot ROM, which loads `/unix` itself — where V8 is started by
/// `load -o bootV8 0` and `run 2`. Every value in `v10` below is copied from
/// the boot sequence `tools/v10drive.exp` has actually booted, not inferred.
