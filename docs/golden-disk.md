# The ipnx golden disk

The disk this project runs is now one we build. This is the record of what is
on it, where each file comes from, and why the TUHS image it replaces can be
retired without losing anything.

Built by [stage 8](build-from-source.md) — `v8/mk/builddisk.sh` — onto an
RP07: root 7942 blocks (partition `a`), `/usr` 464,000 blocks (partition `f`).
Committed to git as `image/ipnx-v8-rp07.img.tar.bz2` — **11.1 MB of the raw
492 MB.**

**It is done.** The full pipeline ran from bare source and every stage passed:

| stage | |
| --- | --- |
| 1 toolchain | `STAGE1 OK` — 14 tools |
| 2 libc | built with our own compiler |
| 3 + fixpoint | **`cmpstage: same=14 differ=0 missing=0`** |
| 4 headers | `STAGE4 OK` — 224 |
| 5 libraries | `STAGE5 OK` — 19 |
| 6 commands | `STAGE6 OK` — **193, zero failures** |
| 7 kernel | `STAGE7 OK` — a 236,672-byte `unix` |
| 8 disk | `STAGE8 OK` |
| 9 self-rebuild | `STAGE9-CHROOT OK` — **9 of 9 tools** |

`tools/retire-check.py` reports **UNIQUE 0**, and `tools/boot-newdisk.sh` boots
the image **alone** and passes all thirteen checks — including `mux` and
`muxterm`, the widened A4 pair, `fortune` and `bcd`, the manual and `tmac`,
`yacc` and `strip` in `/usr/bin`, and `$TERM` proving `login` read our
`/.profile`.

The fixpoint line is the load-bearing one. Moving `yacc` and `strip` out of
`TOOLDIR/bin` was what let the built system run its own generated makefiles,
and it invalidated the staged toolchain — so this run had to redo stages 1–3
to find out whether self-hosting survived it. `same=14 differ=0` says it did.

## Where every file comes from

Four origins, each decided by a generated file rather than by a person, so
none of them can quietly drift from the tree:

| origin | decided by | what it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **built** | `v8/mk/gen/provenance.txt` (`build`) | 206 commands, 19 libraries, 224 headers, the kernel — stages 4 to 7 |
| **carried** | `v8/mk/gen/carry.txt` | 1406 files that exist *only* on the reference image |
| **fast-path** | `v8/mk/gen/fromgold.txt` | 2263 runtime files whose image copy is byte-identical to `v8/` |
| **ours** | `v8/mk/gen/fromsrc.txt`, plus three named in `builddisk.sh` | files where `v8/` and the image differ |

`tools/mkcarry.py` generates the last three from the reference image and
`v8/MANIFEST`. `tools/drive-stages48.sh` refuses to build against a stale
set, the same way it already refuses a stale `mkdep.py`.

### Why "carried" is not a defect

The 1985 tape is not a complete system. Bell Labs shipped binaries whose
sources they never released — all 34 games among them, the whole `sgs`
cross-toolchain for the 5620, `cfront`, `compat`. `v8/MANIFEST` records
every one as `excluded`, with size and sha256, so the gap is auditable
rather than implicit.

`carry.txt` is exactly that set, plus what is on the image and not on the
tape at all: the Labs' own kernel build directory (`/usr/sys/alice`), the
`config(8)` binary, `/usr/inet`'s networking commands, and the ar archives
that the import unpacked into directories.

### Why "fast-path" is not a shortcut

2263 of the 2264 runtime files — nroff's macros, terminal tables, the
manual, the games' data, the 5620's fonts and icons — are byte-identical on
the image and in `v8/`. `mkcarry.py` establishes that with sha256 **every
time it regenerates the lists**, and any file that stops matching moves to
`fromsrc.txt` by itself. The repo stays authoritative; the image is used as
a local cache of bytes we have already proven we own.

It matters because netfs costs a round trip per file through an emulated
VAX, an emulated Interlan and SLiRP — measured at about 30 files a minute.
All 2264 over the wire is ninety minutes, of which eighty-nine deliver bytes
the machine already has mounted. `cpio` does the same set in four seconds.

## Retiring the TUHS image

The question is not "does our disk equal theirs". It does not, and should
not: we build newer binaries from the same source, and we skip their local
state. The question that gates retirement is containment —

> every file on the TUHS image is either on ours, or in git, or deliberately
> regenerated

— and `tools/retire-check.py` decides it. **It now passes:** of 8,940 files,
4,507 are on ours, 4,430 are in git as `MANIFEST` `source` rows, 3 are named
below as deliberately regenerated, and **0 are left over**. Every file falls into one of:

- **on ours** — built or carried.
- **in git** — `MANIFEST` calls it `source`, and the stored file is present.
  The tape's text lives in the repo, so the image is not the only copy.
  Content is proven separately by `tools/v8-import.py --verify`, which
  re-hashes every stored file against `MANIFEST`.
- **by policy** — `/dev` (`makedev.sh` builds it from `v8/proto-dev`), the
  kernel (stage 7 builds it), `/tmp`, `/usr/adm`, `/usr/spool`, `lost+found`,
  `/etc/utmp`, `/etc/mtab`. Each named individually, never a wildcard.

Anything left over is a file that exists nowhere but that disk, and the check
fails while even one remains.

```bash
python3 tools/retire-check.py -v
```

### What the first run found

Four files, none of which a boot test would ever have noticed — the disk
booted cleanly without them:

- **`bcd`** — built into `DESTDIR/usr/games`, and stage 8's copy loop never
  listed `usr/games`. A command we build was absent from the disk while
  every report said it had been built.
- **`yacc`**, **`strip`** — installed to `TOOLDIR/bin`, so they reached the
  toolchain and never the system. `where.txt`, the reference image and our
  own `provenance.txt` all say `/usr/bin`; the build was the odd one out.
  This one had teeth: `mkdep.py` defaults `YACCPATH` to `/usr/bin/yacc`, so
  the system we built could not run its own generated makefiles without an
  override.
- **`wmux`** — ours, from A4. On the tape nowhere, so no `MANIFEST` row
  describes it and no generated list picks it up. It had to be named in
  `builddisk.sh` or it silently did not ship.

Moving `yacc` and `strip` invalidates the stage-3 toolchain, so that fix
needed a full rebuild from stage 1, not a stage-8 re-run.

## Reading a disk without booting it

`tools/v8fs.py` reads a V8 filesystem out of a SIMH RP06/RP07 image directly
from macOS. It made the whole audit above cheap: a question that used to
mean booting a VAX and reading `find` off a serial line now takes a second.

```bash
python3 tools/v8fs.py stat work/myv8/rp07new:a       # superblock + counts
python3 tools/v8fs.py ls   work/myv8/rp07new:f /jerq/bin
python3 tools/v8fs.py cat  work/myv8/rp07new:a /etc/rc
python3 tools/v8fs.py diff work/myv8/rp06v8.golden:g work/myv8/rp07new:f
```

`IMAGE:PART` selects the partition — `a` is root, `g` is `/usr` on an RP06
and `f` on an RP07. The drive type is inferred from the file size.

Every constant is quoted from the tree rather than remembered:

| what | where |
| --- | --- |
| `BSIZE` 1024, `INOPB` 16, `SUPERB` 1, `ROOTINO` 2, `itod`/`itoo` | `usr/include/sys/param.h` |
| 64-byte dinode, "39 used; 13 addresses of 3 bytes each" | `usr/include/sys/ino.h` |
| 16-byte `direct`: `ino_t` + `char[14]` | `usr/include/sys/dir.h` |
| "blocks 0..NADDR-4 are direct blocks" → 10 direct, then single/double/triple | `usr/sys/sys/subr.c` `bmap` |
| partition tables in **sectors**, offsets in **cylinders** | `usr/sys/dev/hp.c` |

The one trap is `usr/src/libc/gen/l3tol.c`: on the VAX a 3-byte disk address
is little-endian with a zero high byte, and the **pdp11 arm of the same
file** packs the identical bytes in a different order. Using the wrong one
gives inode addresses that look almost plausible.

## The image in git

`CLAUDE.md` says big binaries never enter the repo. This is the one
exception, and it is narrow on purpose: exactly one path, our own output,
and only because it is the **input to the next build** — stage 8 lifts
`carry.txt` off it. With it committed, the build's only external input is
the tapes, which `v8/MANIFEST` already accounts for.

```bash
tar -cjf  image/ipnx-v8-rp07.img.tar.bz2 -C work/myv8 rp07new   # pack
tar -xSjf image/ipnx-v8-rp07.img.tar.bz2 -C work/myv8           # and back
tar -tjf  image/ipnx-v8-rp07.img.tar.bz2                        # verify the copy
```

**The `S` in `-xSjf` is the whole point.** A disk image is mostly zeros, and
zip and xz both restore those zeros as *allocated blocks* — a 1.9 GB image
costs 1.9 GB of disk however small the archive. `tar -xS` writes them as
holes instead. Measured: a dense 100 MB of zeros restores to 0 B on disk,
and the content is byte-identical either way. The `S` is only needed on
extract; the archive is the same size without it.

**Zero the file before the build that makes the artefact.** `mkfs` writes a
fresh i-list and free list but does not clear data blocks, so a second stage
8 over the same file leaves the previous run's contents in what the new
filesystem calls free space. Invisible to the guest; extremely visible to the
compressor — an archive that is suddenly much larger is the symptom.

## Building it

Two runs, because moving a tool between `bin` and `usr/bin` invalidates the
staged toolchain and there is no shortcut around that.

```bash
tools/drive-stage1.sh 25200 9370
```

Stages 1–7: the bootstrap toolchain, libc, the toolchain again against it, the
fixpoint comparison, then headers, libraries, commands and the kernel. Hours,
not minutes — and **not because the VAX is slow**. It sits at 6–8% CPU
throughout, waiting on netfs, which costs a round trip per file (task #70).

```bash
rm -f work/myv8/rp07new
tools/drive-stages48.sh 5400 9370 8 9
```

Stages 8 and 9. The `rm` matters: `drive-stages48.sh` only creates the image if
it is absent, and `mkfs` does not clear data blocks, so reusing the file leaves
the previous run's contents in what the new filesystem calls free space.

```bash
tools/verify-golden.sh          # content: containment, lists current, C4
tools/boot-newdisk.sh           # behaviour: boots alone, and has mux, games, man
```

`verify-golden.sh` answers "is the right thing on it" in a second;
`boot-newdisk.sh` costs a VAX boot and answers "does it run". Neither replaces
the other, and it took both directions to prove it: the four files the
containment check found were all on a disk that booted perfectly, and later a
disk that passed containment with **UNIQUE 0** could not reach `login:` at all.

### The disk that walked clean and would not boot

The RP06 variant mounted, `fsck`'d clean, listed 4,507 files and passed
`retire-check.py`. It stopped dead after autoconfig with the CPU idle at 1.7%
— the kernel loaded, the machine came up, and there was no `/etc/init` to
exec, because `/etc/init` was an empty **directory**. So were `/bin/sh`,
`/bin/cc` and 96 others: 424 files in all.

Two independent faults had to line up, and each is worth keeping.

**The cause.** `gen/destdirs.txt` briefly carried two kinds of line — the
directories stage 8 copies, and the 458 exact installed paths `mkcarry.py`
uses to answer "is this file ours" — told apart by a leading tab. But
`builddisk.sh` reads it as `` for d in `grep -v '^#' destdirs.txt` ``, and the
shell splits on `IFS`, which contains tab. The marker was gone before the
shell saw a word, so `mkdir` got all 458. The copy pass then skipped every one
of them, because it is guarded by `test -d $DEST/$d` and that is false for a
file. Carried files were unaffected, which is why `/bin` came out with its
Bell Labs binaries (`csh`, `bls`, `[`) intact and everything we build missing.
*A distinction encoded in leading whitespace cannot survive a consumer that
word-splits, and in 1985 shell every consumer word-splits.* The paths now live
in `gen/destfiles.txt` and nothing in `builddisk.sh` reads it.

**Why nothing caught it.** `retire-check.py` compared *paths*. A directory
named `/bin/sh` satisfies a search for a file named `/bin/sh`, so the gate that
exists to decide whether the TUHS image can be deleted approved a disk that
could not boot. It now compares the inode type, and the difference is not
subtle — the same broken image reports 424 failures where it used to report
none.

The committed RP07 predates the bug and is unaffected: its `/bin` has zero
directories, and its 15-directory `destdirs.txt` is byte-identical to the one
HEAD generates today, so the image in git is what this tree builds.

## Four ways a file goes missing, and what catches each

Worth stating together, because each was found separately and only the last two
have a check that would find them again:

| how it goes missing | caught by |
| --- | --- |
| unique to the reference image, never carried | `retire-check.py` |
| built into `DESTDIR`, but stage 8 doesn't copy that directory | `gen/destdirs.txt`, scraped from the makefiles' own `cp` rules |
| ours, on the tape nowhere, so no manifest describes it | named in `builddisk.sh` — `wmux`, `profile.root`, `profile.skel` |
| an **empty** directory | `gen/dirs.txt` |
| installed as a **directory** where a file belongs | `retire-check.py`, since it compares inode types |

The last one is the one to remember. Every copy pass creates the directories it
puts files in, so a directory with contents appears by itself and one without
never does — and `retire-check.py` skips directories on the reasoning that a
directory has no content to lose. True of the bytes, false of the system:
`uucp` will not run without its spool tree, `at(1)` fails on a missing `past/`,
and `/dev/pt` is where the `sp` pseudo-device puts its stream pipes.

The third row is the uncomfortable one, because it has no generated check at
all — only a name in a script. Anything of ours that belongs on the disk has to
be added there deliberately, and nothing will notice if it is not.

## The loop is closed

The last thing that made the TUHS image necessary was that stage 8 lifted
`carry.txt` off it. So the test of whether it is still needed is simple:
**regenerate the lists from the disk we built and see whether they agree.**

They do — **1405 identical paths from either image**. The reference now
defaults to `work/myv8/rp07new`, which `tar -xSjf image/ipnx-v8-rp07.img.tar.bz2`
recreates from git, and the build's only external input is the tapes, which
`v8/MANIFEST` already accounts for.

Getting the two to agree needed one rule that was missing. Eight files on our
disk are ours and on the tape nowhere — `etc/chroot`, `etc/nmount`, the two
profiles, the `cc -B` pass copies `lib/as` and `lib/ld`, `usr/include/ipnx.h`,
`usr/lib/libpen.a` — and "not on the tape" alone was enough to make `mkcarry`
want to carry them. Carrying a file this build produces is wrong twice over:
the next build makes it again, and carrying it freezes whatever the last build
happened to emit. The rule is derived rather than listed — a file in one of
`gen/destdirs.txt`'s install directories that is not on the tape is ours.

One geometry trap on the way, worth knowing because it will recur: four tools
hardcoded partition `g` for `/usr`. `hp.c` puts `/usr` on **g at cylinder 118
on an RP06** and on **f at cylinder 50 on an RP07**, so the moment the
reference became our own RP07 they failed with *"rp07 has no partition g"*.
`v8fs.usrpart()` derives it from the drive type the image size implies.
