# ipnx-v11 — the edition that never was

*Scope framing, 2026-08-10; streams 5 and 6 added 2026-08-25. Nothing here is committed and
nothing should start before B4 (V10 boots). The purpose of this document is to make the
question answerable: **what could an Eleventh Edition contain without ceasing to be Research
Unix?***

*Six streams. Four of them — Plan 9, Inferno, BSD, the languages — are things that arrive.
The other two are the tree itself: a **ports subsystem** in the format sense (Stream 5) and
the **conversion to ANSI C** (Stream 6). Those two are why v11 needs an edition number
instead of being a layer of ports over v10, and they are only admissible because **v11 is the
first edition of this project that is genuinely ours.***

## The admission rule

"Pure Research Unix" is the constraint, and it is a sharper one than it sounds, because
it is not about vintage or taste. What makes this system Research Unix is not its
utilities — it is the kernel's model of itself. V8 answered "how do I talk to a device?"
with **streams**, "how do I attach a foreign file system?" with the **file system
switch**, "how do I reach another machine?" with **netfs** and Datakit. 4.2BSD answered
the same three questions with sockets, vnodes and TCP-in-the-kernel, and those answers
are *why* BSD is a different system rather than a variant of this one.

So the test for any candidate is one question:

> **Does this change the system's model of itself?**

- **Sockets, vnodes, a 4.4BSD VFS, a wholesale ANSI libc** — yes. Refuse. There are
  a dozen good BSDs and this is not one of them. (And in the case of sockets the point
  is stronger than taste: this system **already has TCP/IP**, with a better answer —
  see below.)
- **`snake`** — no. It reads a terminal and prints characters. Port it freely.

Everything below sorts into three classes by that test:

| Class | What it means | Licence estate |
|---|---|---|
| **Restoration** | The tree had it and lost it, or has half of it | 2017 covenant — already ours |
| **Continuation** | What the same people built next, brought back | Plan 9 / Inferno (MIT) |
| **Furniture** | Third-party programs that make the machine livable | BSD, and case by case |

Restoration first. It is the cheapest, the most defensible, and the most interesting.

## The surprise: a good deal of v11 is already in the tree

Before planning any backport, I listed the V10 source tarball (`work/v10src.tar.bz2`,
25,077 entries) and looked. Research Unix was not sitting still while Plan 9 was being
written down the corridor — the two were the same people, and it shows:

| Found | Where | What it actually is |
|---|---|---|
| **9P** | `cmd/u9fs/` — `u9fs.c`, `9p.h`, `conv.o` | A Plan 9 file server for Unix, in the V10 tree |
| **mk** | `cmd/mk/src/` — `mk.c`, `graph.c`, `run.c`, plus `agh3`/`agh4` | Andrew Hume's `mk`, which Plan 9 later adopted |
| **sam** | `630/bin/sam`, `630/lib/sam.m`, `man/man9/sam.9`, `vol2/sam/` | The terminal half and the paper — see below |
| **netfs** | `netfs/README`, `netfs/serv/`, `netfs/libnetb/` | Deliberately protocol-agnostic; ships servers for 4BSD, V6, V7 and FILES-11 file systems |

The `9p.h` header is worth reading in full, because it dates itself. It opens *"Plan 9
file protocol definitions for use on Unix with ANSI C"*, and the protocol it declares is
the **original 9P, not 9P2000**: `NAMELEN` 28, `Tnop = 50`, and messages that later
vanished — `Tclone`, `Tclwalk`, `Tsession` with DES tickets, a fixed 116-byte `Dir`.

That single file changes the framing of this whole track. **9P is not something ipnx
would be adding to Research Unix. Research Unix already speaks it, and the source is
in the tarball we have.** The V10 machines were serving files to the Plan 9 machines.
Reconnecting that is restoration, not importation.

The `netfs/README` makes the same point from the other side: the servers "may be
compiled with any protocol library", and `libnetb` is merely the one Research used.
A netfs server that speaks 9P instead of netb is a design the tree anticipated.

### There is no sockets work to do — it is already done, and better

The obvious "missing BSD feature" is sockets. It is not missing; it was answered
differently, and the answer is one this project should be pleased to keep.

**V8 already carries the whole Internet stack.** The probe found
`/usr/include/sys/inet/` on the golden image — `in.h`, `ip.h`, `ip_var.h`, `tcp.h`,
`tcp_var.h`, `tcp_fsm.h`, `tcp_seq.h`, `tcp_user.h`, `tcpip.h`, `tcpdebug.h`, `udp.h`,
`udp_var.h`, `udp_user.h`, `mbuf.h`, and a `socket.h` of its own — plus
`/usr/lib/libin.a`. N3 has already driven it: `ipconfig /dev/il0`, ARP to SLiRP, and a
DNS answer back ([n-track-notes.md](n-track-notes.md)).

**V10 has the sources for all of it.** `sys/inet/` holds `tcp_input.c`, `tcp_output.c`,
`tcp_timer.c`, `tcp_subr.c`, `ip_input.c`, `ip_output.c`, `ip_arp.c`, the UDP set — and
`tcp_ld.c`, `ip_ld.c`, `udp_ld.c`, which are **stream line disciplines**, so the stack is
built out of Ritchie's streams rather than bolted alongside them. The userland is in
`ipc/internet/`: `routed`, `arp`, `netstat`, `gettable`/`htable` (pre-DNS host tables),
`tcpconfig`, `udpconfig`, `ipconfig`, `loopback`, `dkslip` — and `interlan.c`, for the
same NI1010 board our N2 SIMH model emulates. `ipc/libin/` is the user library:
`tcp_lib.c`, `udp_lib.c`, `in_host.c`, `in_service.c`, `in_address.c`, `in_ntoa.c`,
`in_ntoh.s`.

And the API is the interesting part. From `ipc/libin/tcp_lib.c`, a connection is
obtained by *opening a file*:

```c
for(n = 01; n < 100; n += 2){
        sprintf(name, "/dev/tcp%02d", n);
        fd = open(name, 2);
```

then a `struct tcpuser` is written to the descriptor and the reply read back. That is
Plan 9's `/net` — the network as a file system — running on Research Unix **years before
Plan 9 shipped**. It is not a poor relation of sockets; it is the design sockets are
usually contrasted *with*, and it is already here.

The conclusion for this track: **do not port a sockets layer, and do not write one.**
If a BSD program needs `socket()`/`connect()`, the compatibility shim is a small
`libcompat` addition over `/dev/tcp` — and `hunt`, the one game that needs a network,
becomes a test of that shim rather than a reason to import an API.

### The gap worth naming: sam's host side is missing

There is **no `cmd/sam/`** in the V10 source tarball. What survives is the 630 terminal
half (`630/bin/sam`, `630/lib/sam.m`, and `630/bin/samuel`), the manual page
`man/man9/sam.9`, and the paper in `vol2/sam/`. The editor's host side — the half that
does the editing — is not in the distribution.

Pike's `sam` is in plan9port, MIT-licensed, and its terminal protocol is documented in
the very paper the tree still carries. So one of the more compelling things v11 could
do is **put sam's host side back**, against a terminal half that is already sitting on
the disk. That is a restoration with a working target to test against on day one.

## Stream 1 — Plan 9 *(the strongest case)*

**Licensing is clean.** On 23 March 2021 Nokia Bell Labs transferred the Plan 9
copyright to the Plan 9 Foundation, which relicensed all previous editions under the
**MIT licence**; plan9port carries the same MIT terms. That is compatible with this
repository's MIT content and with a free app, and it is a far easier estate to reason
about than the 2017 covenant.

[Plan 9 from User Space](https://9fans.github.io/plan9port/) is the porting reference,
not the source of truth: it is exactly the exercise of adapting Plan 9 code to a Unix,
already done once, with the awkward parts visible in its diffs. v11 runs the same
exercise against a much older Unix.

Ranked by value against tractability:

1. **`sam`** — restores a missing half, has a live terminal target, MIT. Start here.
2. **9P revival** — build `cmd/u9fs` as it stands and see what it does. Cheap, and it
   is evidence for the question below rather than an answer to it.

   > **Deferred to Track B, deliberately (2026-08-10).** Whether netfs's successor
   > should be **9P** rather than a documented netb is a genuine fork in the road, and
   > N4–N7 will arrive at it. It is not worth resolving now: V10 is unbuilt, the
   > interface is unrebuilt, and a decision taken this early would be taken on the
   > least evidence it will ever have. Take the netb route on the N track, keep 9P in
   > view, revisit when Track B is actually there.
3. **`rc`** — Duff's shell. Self-contained, small, and the one Plan 9 program whose
   absence is felt daily. No kernel dependency.
4. **`mk`** — already present; the work is building it, not porting it, and it makes
   every subsequent port easier.
5. **Later, if at all**: `acme` (wants a mouse-and-windows environment — the 5620 is
   the obvious host and this is genuinely interesting), `plumber`, `factotum`.

## Stream 2 — Inferno *(parked: a maybe, depending on licensing)*

**Decision, 2026-08-10: parked.** Inferno's estate runs Lucent → Vita Nuova with GPLv2
and MIT terms at different points in its history, and until that is settled per
component there is nothing here to plan. It stays a maybe. The notes below are for
whoever picks it up, not a commitment.

Inferno divides cleanly into a tractable half and a moonshot, and conflating them is
the main risk to this stream.

**Tractable: Styx.** Inferno's protocol is 9P — in the 4th edition, Styx *is* 9P2000.
Since V10 already carries a 9P server, "Inferno interoperability" at the protocol level
is the same work item as the 9P revival above. An ipnx that can mount an Inferno
namespace, or be mounted by one, needs no VM at all.

**Moonshot: Dis and Limbo.** Inferno's own literature says it runs useful applications
in as little as 1 MB and needs no memory-mapping hardware, which sounds encouraging
until you count what `emu` actually wants from its host: ANSI C, threads, and a
`select`-shaped event loop. V10's compiler is pre-ANSI, and the process model is not
BSD's. This is a research question, not a plan — and if it is ever attempted it is
plausibly its own edition rather than part of v11.

Licensing needs a pass before any of it: Inferno's history runs Lucent → Vita Nuova,
with GPLv2 and MIT terms at different points, and a v11 image would then be mixing
**three** estates (the 2017 covenant, Plan 9's MIT, Inferno's whichever). That is a
tractable problem but it must be answered before code, not after.

## Stream 3 — BSD *(userland only, and mostly the games)*

The rule from the admission test: **take programs, refuse personality.** No sockets, no
VFS, no libc replacement. What is left is genuinely worth having, and the games are the
clearest case — they are pure userland, they were mostly Berkeley-original, and they are
the part of BSD that has no modern substitute worth using.

### What V8 actually has

From a scratch boot of the golden image (`work/myv8/v8-inspect-name.log`), `/usr/games`
on V8 is richer than expected:

```
Mail  arithmetic  atc  back  banner  bcd  bigp  canfield  cbrogue  festoon
fish  fortune  hack  hangman  hanoi  mille  ogre  ppt  quiz  rogomatic
rogue  rogue52  rogue53  sail  say  scapegoat  snake  sread  thanks
tictactoe  tso  worm  zork
```

Three versions of `rogue`, plus **`rogomatic`** — the rogue-playing program — plus
`hack`, `zork` and `sail`. This machine was played on.

### The free win nobody would look for: V10 → V8

`v10src/games/` contains games V8 does not have, in the same copyright estate, under the
same 2017 covenant, compiled by the same compiler:

> `adv` · `boggle` · `doctor` · `morse` · `pacman` · `psych` · `rain` · `rot` ·
> `trek` · `wump` · `imp` · `word_clout` · `crypt`/`des`

**These are not ports.** They are intra-family transfers: no licence question, no
ANSI problem, no API skew of any consequence, and the ingest path (B0, and netfs after
N7) already exists. They should be the first thing Track C's machinery is tested on,
precisely *because* they are easy — a ports tree whose first entry is a hard port is a
ports tree that never gets debugged.

It also cuts the other way, and is worth recording: `festoon`, `doctor`, `psych`,
`word_clout`, `say`, `thanks`, `imp`, `tso` are **Research-only** games with no BSD
equivalent. The traffic was never one-directional.

### What neither has, from BSD

Against the NetBSD-derived `bsd-games` collection, the genuine additions are:

| Candidate | Why | Difficulty |
|---|---|---|
| `robots`, `worms`, `battlestar`, `cribbage`, `monop`, `gomoku` | Self-contained curses games with no equivalent here | Low — curses + de-ANSI-fication |
| `phantasia` | Multi-user persistent RPG; uses shared score files | Medium |
| `pom`, `number`, `caesar`, `primes`, `random` | Trivial filters, an afternoon each | Trivial |
| **`hunt`** | **Real-time multiplayer over a network** | **High — and that is the point** |

`hunt` is the one to aim at. It is the only game in the collection that needs the
machine to be a *networked* machine, so it lands squarely on the N track: two ipnx
instances, or an ipnx and a Mac, playing hunt over the `il0` interface that N3 already
proved. That is a demonstration nothing else in this project can make.

And two that need no work at all: **`rogue`** is already on V8 three times over
(`rogue`, `rogue52`, `rogue53`, plus `cbrogue` and `scapegoat`), and so is
**`rogomatic`**, the Carnegie Mellon program that plays it. **`adventure`** is V10's
`games/adv`, with a manual page in `man/mana/adventure.6`.

**Provenance rule: port from 4.4BSD-Lite or its descendants, never from 4.3BSD.**
4.4BSD-Lite was the release constructed after the 1994 USL settlement specifically to
contain no AT&T source, and UCB dropped the advertising clause in 1999, so the modern
`bsd-games` lineage is 3-clause BSD with traceable provenance. 4.3BSD is a worse
starting point for identical code.

## Stream 4 — the languages *(mostly already here)*

The same reconnaissance that found `u9fs` found that most of the languages one would
think of porting are already in `cmd/`. These are **builds, not ports**:

| Asked for | Status | Where |
|---|---|---|
| **BSD Pascal** | Present and complete | `cmd/pascal/` — `pi`, `px`, `pxp`, `pc0`, `libpc`, and Berkeley's error-recovering `eyacc`; man page at `man/mana/pc.1` |
| **Fortran** | Present, and it is *ours* | `cmd/f77/` with `libF77`/`libI77` — Stuart Feldman wrote it at Bell Labs, single-handedly |
| Others | Present | `hoc`, `icon`, `sml`, `spitbol`, `sno`, `snocone`, `matlab`, `bc`/`dc`, `ratfor`, `efl`, `pfort`, `cfront` (C++) |

### Franz Lisp — the real port on this list

`man/mana/lisp.1` documents `lisp`, `liszt` (the compiler) and `lxref` — and its title
line reads `.TH LISP 1 "alice sola"`, naming *alice*, one of the lab's machines. So Franz
Lisp ran on the Research Unix machines, but its **source is not in the distribution**
(`mana` is the local manual — software installed on the machine, not shipped with it).

That makes it a genuine port, and an unusually well-suited one: Franz Lisp was written at
Berkeley **for the VAX**, shipped with BSD, and ran on 4.1BSD — which is precisely what V8
is derived from. Very little else from that decade fits this hardware so exactly.

**Licence is the open question.** Berkeley origin and BSD distribution suggest BSD terms;
Wikipedia describes it as proprietary freeware; Franz Inc. commercialised the lineage.
Settle it before starting — the same discipline applied to Inferno.

### S, and the R question

**S is out of reach, and it is the one that stings.** John Chambers, Rick Becker and Allan
Wilks wrote it at Bell Labs; it ran on these machines; source versions were distributed
from 1981. Then Bell Labs gave StatSci an exclusive licence in 1993, Insightful bought it,
and TIBCO bought Insightful in 2008. **The 2017 covenant does not reach it** — it was
never part of the Research Unix distribution — and no free source exists.

**R is not the substitute it looks like.** It is GPL and it descends from S, but it is a
1993 reimplementation that wants ANSI C, a Fortran runtime and far more memory than a
VAX-11/780 has. The interesting sub-question is narrower and worth recording: V10 carries
`cmd/gcc/` (145 files, an early 1.x with m68k and ns32k targets) and `man/mana/gcc.1`, so
**an ANSI compiler was running on these machines**. Whether it builds is the single fact
that decides how much post-1989 software is reachable at all.

The honest position on S: it needs someone at TIBCO to say yes. That is a letter to write,
not a task to schedule — but it is worth writing, because a working S on a VAX would be a
better memorial to Chambers, Becker and Wilks than any amount of engineering elsewhere.

## Stream 5 — the ports subsystem *(machinery, and this time it is ours)*

Streams 1 to 4 are all "what arrives". This one is "how", and it is in v11 rather than
beside it because a ports tree is not a build script — it is a **format**, and choosing the
format is an editorial act of exactly the kind the admission rule governs.

The model is FreeBSD's: one directory per port, and the directory *is* the record. Distfile
name and origin, a checksum, a patch series applied in order, build and install rules, and a
declared dependency list. Nothing about a port lives outside its own directory, so a port can
be read, audited and deleted as one thing.

What this system imposes on that model, and none of it is optional:

- **`mk`, not `make`.** Per [v10-build.md](v10-build.md), the tree is one dialect by then, and
  the port format inherits it. mk earns its place here rather than merely being consistent:
  `%` patterns and `:P:` predicates can express "rebuild when the distfile changed", which
  suffix rules cannot.
- **The fetch is host-side, and that is not a limitation to fix.** A 1989 system has no
  HTTPS, no `gzip` (1992) and no `bzip2` (1996) — it carries `compress`(`.Z`) and
  `pack`(`.z`). So a port's distfile is fetched and decompressed on the Mac and served over
  netfs, exactly as `tools/v10-tapes.sh` already does for the six tapes. **Decompressing is
  not extracting**: the archive is unpacked *on the guest*, so case collisions and long names
  are resolved by the case-sensitive filesystem that will hold them, never by macOS.
- **14-byte filenames** remain a hard constraint on what a port may contain, and belong in
  the format as a check rather than a surprise at extraction time.
- **Generated makefiles coexist rather than compete.** For an autoconf'd upstream, `configure`
  produces the *answers* — which sources, which defines, which libraries — and the port's
  mkfile includes that as a fragment. A version bump regenerates the fragment and leaves the
  port rules alone. There is nothing to do about this in V10: the tree holds zero
  `configure`, `configure.in`, `Makefile.in` or `config.status` files, because autoconf 1.0
  is 1991 and every build file on the tape is hand-written.

The relationship to Track C is stated below, and it changed on 2026-08-25.

## Stream 6 — ANSI C throughout *(the tree, not what arrives in it)*

The other five streams add things. This one changes what is already here, and it is the
reason v11 needs its own edition number rather than being a layer of ports over v10.

**The mess stays in V10.** V10 is a restoration and has to remain authentic; standardising is
this edition's job. And the mess is real, not aesthetic: V10 was never built from scratch, it
accreted, and the tape shows it. The `libc/mkfile` that produced the shipped `libc.a` names
`cc` for members only `lcc` can compile; 25 of the 261 members are already ANSI (`int
fprintf(FILE *f, const char *fmt, ...)`, `void *`, `size_t`, `<stdarg.h>`); and the tree
carries **two generations of stdio at once** — the K&R `doprnt.c`/`doscan.c` set `omakefile`
builds, and the ANSI `_dtoa`/`vfprintf`/`snprintf` set the archive actually contains. So
V10's per-file compiler requirement is mixed and undocumented, and **no makefile on the tape
is a reliable guide to which file needs which.** Restoring V10 means living with that. V11 is
where it stops: one language, one compiler, and the question never asked per file again.

The compiler decides the shape of everything else, and it is not settled. Roadmap
**D-A1–D-A4** carries the detail; the four facts that matter here:

1. **Plan 9 did target the VAX-11/750 — the machine we emulate.** The Plan 9 wiki's *Other
   hardware* page: "Vax 750 - The earliest file server port. The compiler binary was recently
   found but the source appears to have been lost in the mists of time." An earlier draft of
   the roadmap asserted the opposite from two primary sources that both simply omitted it;
   absence from the released suite is not absence from history.
2. **A found binary cannot be the standard compiler of an edition built from source.** It is
   an oracle — something to compare output against — exactly as V10's prebuilt `ccom` and `as`
   were for Track B.
3. **The only ANSI VAX compiler we actually hold is `lcc`**, and it is buildable from source:
   front end `cmd/lcc/c/`, VAX back end `gen3/gen.c` + `gen2/vax/`, preprocessor
   `cmd/lcc/ph/`. `sys/inet/` even has an `lccmkfile`, so lcc was compiling real system code
   on the tape rather than sitting unused.
4. **The alternative is to reconstruct a VAX back end for the Plan 9 compiler**, which is
   bounded work rather than a wish: Plan 9 back ends are deliberately small — a shared front
   end plus a per-architecture generator, which is why the suite carries seven — and VAX code
   generation is answered twice over in source we own, V8's `cmd/pcc2/` and V10's own
   `cmd/ccom/vax/`, with `libc/sys/*.s` and `cmd/as/instrs` fixing the encodings and calling
   convention. The machine description does not have to be rediscovered, only re-expressed.

Two orderings are not preferences:

- **Back end before port.** A converted tree with no compiler to check it against is
  unverifiable; a back end can be tested against V10's existing binaries the moment it emits
  anything.
- **libc before everything.** The same reason stage 2 precedes stage 3 in Track B: everything
  links against it.

And the conversion runs the *opposite* way to the compatibility work in the next section.
`libcompat` exists so post-1989 sources can be built by a K&R compiler; this stream retires
the need for it by making the compiler ANSI. `PATCHES.md:374` already records which direction
each edition takes: "The conversion direction is ANSI to K&R, and that is deliberate. V10
keeps the 1989 language; V11 is where the tree becomes ANSI."

## The real cost, and it is not the games

An earlier draft of this document asserted that V8's libc was "4.1BSD-era" — `index` and
`bcopy` native, `strchr` and `memcpy` absent — and that ports would need the *reverse* of
the usual ANSI-ification pass. **That was wrong, and measuring it changed the plan.**
`tools/v8-libc-probe.exp` boots a scratch copy of the golden image and asks
`nm /lib/libc.a` directly (log: `work/myv8/v8-libc-probe.log`).

### What V8's libc actually has

| Present | Absent |
|---|---|
| `strchr` `strrchr` `strpbrk` `strspn` `strcspn` `strtok` | `strtol` `strtod` `strstr` |
| `memcpy` `memcmp` `memset` `qsort` | `memmove` `atexit` `vprintf` `vfprintf` |
| `index` `rindex` `strcpy` (and `/usr/include/string.h`) | **`bcopy` `bzero`** |

So the string library is largely the ANSI one already, and the two functions the old
draft named as "native" are the two that are missing. V10 closes most of the rest: its
`libc/gen/` and `libc/stdio/` carry `strtol`, `strtod`, `memmove`, `atexit`, `vprintf`
and `vfprintf`.

### The wall is the compiler, and only the compiler

```
$ echo 'int f(int a, char *b){return a;} main(){exit(f(0,0));}' > /tmp/p.c; cc /tmp/p.c
"/tmp/p.c":1: syntax error
"/tmp/p.c":1: expected a NAME in list
"/tmp/p.c":1: saw TYPE
```

V8's `cc` (1985, with `/lib/ccom`, `/lib/cpp`, `/lib/c2`) is **K&R and will not take a
prototype**. There is no `stdlib.h`, no `stddef.h`, no `unistd.h`; variadic code uses
`varargs.h`, not `stdarg.h`.

**V10 is a different machine on this point.** Its tree ships `cmd/lcc/` — Fraser and
Hanson's ANSI C compiler — including a `gen2/vax-v9/` back end, ANSI header sets, and
`cmd/dist/v10/lcc-incl/` supplying V10's own `dirent.h`, `unistd.h` and `utime.h`. It
also carries `cmd/gcc/` (145 files, an early 1.x). `sys/inet/` even has an `lccmkfile`,
so lcc was building real system code, not sitting unused.

### What this means for `libcompat`

Much smaller than planned, and pointed at the right target:

- **A prototype-eliding macro** and the K&R rewrite discipline. This is the whole job on
  V8, and it is mechanical.
- **Seven functions**, not a string library: `strtol`, `strtod`, `strstr`, `memmove`,
  `atexit`, `vprintf`, `vfprintf` — several liftable from V10's own `libc/gen/`.
- **`bcopy`/`bzero`** as one-line wrappers over `memcpy`/`memset`, for BSD sources that
  assume them.
- **14-byte filenames** remain a hard constraint on what a port may contain.

And the strategic point: **on V10 the compiler problem may simply not exist.** If lcc
builds, ANSI C is available, and the entire framing of "port backwards to K&R" applies
only to V8. That single question is worth answering early because it decides how much
post-1989 software is reachable at all.

## Where this sits relative to ipnx-ports

These two tracks are easy to confuse and should not be:

- **ipnx-ports (Track C) is the mechanism.** How anything third-party is fetched,
  patched, built and installed. It is infrastructure and it is edition-agnostic.
- **ipnx-v11 (Track D) is the editorial question.** *What belongs in the edition* —
  which of the above is Research Unix continuing, and which is merely software that
  runs on it.

The BSD games are built by Track C and chosen by Track D. `sam` is the same.

**Revised 2026-08-25.** This section used to end "Nothing about v11 requires new machinery;
it requires a decision about what the edition is." That is no longer true, and the reason is
worth stating rather than patching over. **V11 is the first edition of this project that is
genuinely ours** — V8 and V10 are restorations where the tape decides the contents and every
deviation must be argued for, whereas everything in streams 1 to 6 is a choice. An edition
that chooses its own contents needs to say *how* things arrive as well as *what*, so the port
format is part of the edition (Stream 5) rather than a service it consumes. Track C still
builds and Track D still chooses; what changed is that the format Track C implements is
specified here.

That distinction also breaks the numbering rule stated in the README — "the **edition** is
Bell Labs' and is not ours to increment; the **release** counts what this project has made of
it". V11 increments the edition. It is the one place that rule does not hold, and that is
precisely what marks the boundary between restoration and authorship.

## Open questions

- Does the V10 `u9fs` build under V10's own compiler, or was it maintained on another
  machine? (`cmd/u9fs/*.o` are present — objects for *some* target.)
- Should netfs's successor be 9P outright, making N4–N7 a Plan 9 story rather than a
  netb one? This is a fork in the road and it arrives before v11 does.
- Is `630/bin/sam` the terminal half only, or does the 630 support tree also carry a
  host binary? (Determines whether "restore sam" starts from a working reference.)
- Which Inferno licence applies to which components, and does a three-estate image
  create any obligation the covenant does not already impose?
- Is v11 an *image* (a bootable `v11.disk`) or a *layer* over v10? The former is
  cleaner to reason about; the latter is what actually happens if ports are how things
  arrive.
