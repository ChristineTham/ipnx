# Roadmap

*Tracks A and B share one spike: Track A ships a real product on proven ground; Track B is the
research moonshot that lands into the same app shell. C and D are later and declared here so
the README's scope has somewhere to point. Update checkboxes and the status line as work
completes.*

**Current phase: Track B — the distribution, completed.** V8 is closed out: Track A through
A5, Track S built the disk the app ships, and B0/B0.5/B0.6 are done.

**The goal was a V10 kernel with the V10 toolchain running on it** — not a complete userland,
but a machine that can compile itself, because nothing else can be trusted before it: a V10
command built on a V8 host is validated against the wrong kernel.

**That goal is met.** V10's own compiler, assembler and libc came off the tape as linked
binaries and ran on the V8 kernel; V10 went on to build its own `libc`, its own `/bin` and the
whole `world` target, and it compiled **its own kernel**, which boots to a login prompt and
halts cleanly. The build is `updatebuild` then `ipnxbuild` on the machine, reading one
`mkfile` and one `patch` — [v10-build.md](v10-build.md) is the whole of it, read off the
scripts themselves.

**What is left is completeness, and it is measurable.** Against the tape's own `Admin`
manifests, 27 of the 50 files `/usr/lib` should hold are not built, and `/usr/src` has never
been read against those lists directory by directory. After that: the experience — `mux`,
`sam`, and "Edition 10" in the app — plus, still unexercised from Track A, `mux`/`jim` under
the Mac's real pointer, which needs a human at a mouse, and the App Store steps, which need
the Apple account.

## Phase A0 — desktop spike *(shared by both tracks; no iOS code)*

Runbook: [spike-a0.md](spike-a0.md)

- [x] Build SIMH `vax780` on macOS (classic 3.12-5; zip unpacks into `sim/`; warnings only)
- [x] Produce the V8 disk via myv8 (`rp06v8`, ~2.5 min; all media bundled in the repo)
- [x] Boot V8 to multi-user login on the Mac (console `# ` → `^D` → DZ gettys)
- [x] Connect a terminal emulator and run `mux` — *done (Session 6): the "55K stall" was
      mux idling at its desktop — 32ld sends only text+data (50,324 B), not the 144,603-B
      file. Menu → sweep → layer → shell → `date` + motd all round-trip; screenshots in
      `work/shots-final/`. Full story: spike-a0-results.md Session 6*
- [x] Measure `muxterm` download time — *definitive (Session 6): wire burst 55,156 B
      (50,324 payload + protocol overhead); ~98 s at ÷8 turbo, ~6 min computed at the
      1200-baud NVRAM default. **A0/A2 concluded pacing lived in dmd_core's DUART alone;
      A3 corrected that** — SIMH's DZ was throttling to the guest's programmed 9600 in
      series with it, and ÷8 happened to be 9600-equivalent, making the two
      indistinguishable. See [a3-notes.md](a3-notes.md)*
- [x] Record findings in `docs/spike-a0-results.md`; runbook corrected — all VERIFY markers
      resolved 2026-08-09 (aap/blit and the socat bridge were superseded, not executed)

*Exit criteria: `mux` usable end-to-end; serial-pacing fix chosen (config vs. patch).*

## Track A — the product (V8 inside)

### A1 — text mode on iPad *(complete 2026-08-09; see [a1-notes.md](a1-notes.md))*
- [x] open-simh built as an arm64 static library (CMake → xcframework) — *`libsimh/`,
      pinned `a1f57fa`, synchronous I/O compiled in (the V8-safe mode, permanently);
      device + simulator slices, plus a macOS `vax780cli` harness that desktop-proved
      the whole app protocol before any Swift ran*
- [x] App boots bundled `v8.disk` to `login:` in a SwiftTerm console view — *the
      ipnx app (team RPL5R637DS): autoboot with self-healing fsck
      reaches `login:` in ~25–30 s on the iPad Pro simulator; evidence in
      `work/shots-a1-final/`*
- [x] Background/foreground survival (SIMH save/restore) — *suspend + `save` via the
      SIMH remote console on background (zero CPU while paused), `continue` on
      foreground, `restore` on cold relaunch — 3/3 terminate→relaunch cycles with a
      live console after restore; snapshots are consumed the moment the machine runs
      again, so unclean kills cold-boot and fsck heals*

### A2 — the Blit experience *(complete 2026-08-09; see [a2-notes.md](a2-notes.md))*
- [x] dmd_core built for `aarch64-apple-ios` (C FFI staticlib), firmware 8;7;3 —
      *`libdmd/`: the crate's built-in FFI + a logged patch for the two BREAK exports;
      echo-test smoke proof*
- [x] Metal framebuffer view (800×1024×1, phosphor tint) — *packed VRAM as R8Uint,
      fragment-shader bit expansion, dirty-flag uploads*
- [x] Serial transport v1 (localhost) → v2 (in-process, unthrottled) — *v1 shipped;
      v2 deliberately deferred: the ÷8 DUART turbo already puts the mux download at
      ~100 s measured on iPad — the pacing floor is the DUART, not the transport*
- [x] Input mapping: touch/Pencil/trackpad → 3-button mouse; hardware + soft keyboard —
      *trackpad-style counter deltas + B1/B2/B3 latches + BREAK; UIKeyInput keyboard;
      hover/Pencil polish deferred to A3*
- [x] `mux` + `jim` usable end-to-end on iPad — *login on the 5620 → mux download →
      B3 menu → New → sweep → layer with root shell (`date` + motd round-trip); jim
      downloads and takes over a layer (deep editing choreography untested)*

### A3 — ship v1 *(complete 2026-08-09 except the steps only a person can do; see [a3-notes.md](a3-notes.md))*
- [x] Settings, snapshots, disk import/export via Files — *phosphor + scaling
      (the "Crisp" mode is the moiré fix: exactly 2× on an iPad Pro 13-inch),
      pointer speed, 5620 NVRAM persistence, snapshot visibility + discard,
      staged disk import/reset applied at next launch so nothing is swapped
      under a running VAX*
- [x] Licenses/credits screen (acknowledgements) — *2017 covenant, TUHS and
      Berkeley, open-simh / dmd_core / 5620 firmware / SwiftTerm; the statement
      PDF is linked, and bundling it is on the submission checklist*
- [x] App Store prep — *icon (generated, `tools/gen-icons.swift`), privacy
      manifest, export-compliance boolean, category, v1.0, sandbox + hardened
      runtime; **submission itself needs the Apple account** —
      [app-store.md](app-store.md)*

### A3+ — the Mac *(not originally scoped; complete 2026-08-09)*
- [x] macOS slices for both xcframeworks
- [x] Native macOS app target sharing one source folder — *V8 boots to `login:`
      on the 5620 in a native window; real 3-button mouse (right-click is mux's
      menu); snapshot on quit, never on hide*

### A4 — a bigger, sharper, continuous screen *(2026-08-10; [screen-size.md](screen-size.md))*
- [x] Resize a running 5620 and widen its text grid to 127 columns — *the
      `display` Bitmap is ROM `.data`; the grid is 24 byte immediates*
- [x] Two fixed presets, Original (800×1024, 88 cols) and Wide (1152×1024, 127),
      with the window locked to the CRT's shape instead of the reverse
- [x] The screen survives a quit: `screen.bin` painted back once the terminal
      has booted
- [x] The *session* survives too — the start-of-session nudge now waits for the
      firmware's idle PC window and always fires *(this is what "restored
      session is mute" actually was)*
- [x] Area-average sampling in the fragment shader, from the drawable's real
      pixel count — no shimmer at fractional scale, bit-identical at integral
- [x] Controls out of the terminal field: a real `NSToolbar` on the Mac, a
      chrome bar on iPad, and a plain bezel around the tube
- [x] `jim` needs no widening at all — `mux.h` makes `display` a *pointer*
      (`(*Jdisplayp)`) that the layer system fills in at runtime, so every
      program running in a layer follows a resized screen for free. `3nm`
      confirms jim exports `Jdisplayp` and no `display`. **The premise of this
      item was wrong**; only `muxterm` carries a real Bitmap, because it *is*
      the layer system
- [x] `muxterm` widened as a mechanism — `tools/widen-jerq.exp` patches the
      20-byte Bitmap at file offset 50512 (stride 25→36, `corner.x` 800→1152)
      into `muxterm.w`, selected by `/usr/jerq/bin/wmux` through `$MUXTERM`.
      Stock binaries deliberately untouched
- [x] **Driven**: `tools/drive-widemux.sh` boots the image on the desktop SIMH
      and runs `tools/dmdbridge` against a resized 5620 with `wmux`. Rightmost
      lit pixel **x=1151 of 1152** (220,167 lit) against **x=648** for stock
      muxterm, which turned out not to be narrow but *invisible* — it draws
      into the framebuffer's old address. Evidence in
      `work/shots-a4-wide-evidence/`; the image is now the golden one

### A5 — the interface, and the name *(2026-08-10; [ui-redesign.md](ui-redesign.md))*
- [x] Rename the app from **Edition** to **ipnx** — project, both targets, both
      schemes, the source folder and the `@main` struct. The product was always
      `ipnx.app`; only the scaffolding lagged
- [x] Raise the deployment targets to iOS 26 / macOS 26, so the glass is
      unconditional and there is one visual design to test rather than two
- [x] **One listen port per DZ line**, replacing the single mux-wide listener —
      *without this a tab labelled `tty03` is a guess, because `tmxr_poll_conn`
      assigns by connection order and `/.profile` picks TERM from the tty*
- [x] Nine sessions — console + `tty00`..`tty07` — each lazily started, each
      keeping its scrollback, replacing the three-face picker
- [x] Windows grouped by terminal shape (vt100 / vt100w / dmd), tabs within a
      shape *(forced by the missing `TIOCGWINSZ`, not chosen)*
- [x] Console read-only behind a lock; `tty01` logs itself in as root, gated on
      seeing `login:` rather than on a timer
- [x] Liquid Glass on the chrome only — nothing composites over the emulated
      raster
- [x] App icon restyled as a stylised licence plate: `ipnx` over LIVE FREE OR
      DIE, after the plate Armando Stettner gave away at USENIX
- [x] Verified on both platforms — evidence in `work/shots-a5/`: the console
      holds the whole boot transcript, `tty01` reports **line 1** and logs in,
      `tty02` reports **line 2** and stops at `login:`, two windows run one VAX,
      and the iPad shows the same tab bar and `+` menu
- [x] Verify closing the 5620's window reclaims its CPU — measured on the Mac
      app, one instance, driven through the app's own File ▸ Open Terminal menu:
      **16% → 112% → 15% → 112%** (baseline, 5620 open, window closed, reopened).
      The dmd thread is genuinely gone, not idling — the WE32100 does not idle at
      all, so a stopped one is the only cheap one. `close(line)` → `dmd.stop()` →
      `stopFlag.set()` → the runloop's `while !stop.isSet` exits, and reopening
      power-cycles it cleanly (`5620 powered on` twice in the log)

## Track B — the V10 restoration *(the build is [v10-build.md](v10-build.md))*

**V10 boots, builds itself, and has produced a golden. The distribution is not complete.**

### How it was done

| | |
|---|---|
| **B1** the toolchain | The surviving tapes are not source-only: they carry linked VAX executables, among them V10's C compiler, its assembler and a complete `libc.a`, and those **ran unmodified on the V8 kernel**. Only `cpp`, `c2` and `ld` had to be built from source. |
| **B2** the tree | Six TUHS tapes analysed and merged into one reconstructed `/usr`, newer mtime winning where two disagree. Case collisions resolved, every `ar` source archive dissolved into a directory of its members with an `ORDER` file. That tree is `v10/`. |
| **B3** the kernel and the first boot | With the V10 toolchain hosted on V8, a V10 kernel configuration was written and a kernel compiled, then a root filesystem — `/bin`, `/lib`, `/etc`. A disk carrying both booted. That is the moment V10 stopped being a cross-build. |
| **B3.5** the build | From there the disk was built out on itself. `v10/usr/src/build` is the whole of it: `ipnxbuild` and `ipnxclean` a matched pair, `mkv10`/`mkipnx`/`mkimage` the archive chain, `updatebuild` the one command that touches a share. |

The V8-hosted cross-build that reached step B3 no longer exists in this repository, and
does not need to: the machine builds itself now.

### B3.6 — the distribution, completed *(next)*

The tapes carry their own manifests of what a V10 machine holds — `cmd/Admin/binfiles`,
`etcfiles`, `libfiles`, `ulibfiles` — and they are the measure nobody has finished reading
against. As at 2026-09-16:

- `/bin` — 4 of 57 not built (`iostat`, `mail`, `rmail`, `rsh`), each with a reason in the mkfile
- `/etc` — 4 of 56 not built (`analyze`, `backsh`, `catman`, `dklisten`), no source on any tape
- **`/usr/lib` — 27 of 50 not built**: the PDP-11 cross-toolchain, seven libraries, and troff
  and man data files, some of which V8 carries and V10's tapes do not

- [ ] Read `/usr/src` against the `Admin` manifests **directory by directory**, not by pattern
- [ ] Decide per missing file: buildable, absent from every tape, or fetchable from V8
- [ ] A host-side tool to create the blank disk image file `mkimage` formats — V10 cannot make
      a sparse file, and the script that used to do it on the host was deleted

### B4 — the V10 experience

- [x] Multi-user: `init`, gettys, `login`. The golden reaches `login:` and halts cleanly.
- [ ] `mux` against dmd_core (firmware 8;7;3 — the protocol is unchanged from V8).
      **There is no 5620 `muxterm` on the tape**: a scan of `blit/`, `src/history/ix/src/jerq`
      and `src/630` for the WE32100 COFF magic finds zero files. `blit/` is the 68000 Blit
      tree, so the host side is there as a VAX binary (`blit/bin/mux`) while the *terminal*
      side exists only as source under `history/ix/src/jerq/`. Two routes, and choosing is an
      authenticity decision: build a WE32100 `muxterm` from that source (needs a WE32100
      compiler, which `blit/lib/ccom` is not), or download V8's `muxterm` under V10's `mux`.
      Cheapest decisive experiment: build `32ld` from `history/ix/src/jerq/32ld/32ld.c` — a
      VAX program — and see whether it pushes anything down a DZ line into dmd_core.
      [v10-log/2026-08-18.md](v10-log/2026-08-18.md)
- [ ] **`sam` and `samterm`** — the reason `v10blit` matters, and something V8 never had

### B5 — merge into the app

**Two machines, two goldens, and the user picks.** V10 ships *beside* V8, not instead of it,
and V8's golden is not a staging area for V10's. The app has been shaped for this since
2026-08-16: the support directory is *app first, edition inside* (`Machine.support`), and
`MachineSpec` holds every difference between the editions as data.

The constraint that falls out of it: **nothing in Track B may modify the V8 golden.** V8 is
the build host and the shipped Eighth Edition, and those are the same disk.

- [ ] "Edition 10" as a second machine beside V8, chosen at launch
- [ ] A second golden, committed on its own terms
- [ ] Reconcile the drive type: `MachineSpec.swift` attaches V10 as an **RA81**, while
      `ipnx-v10.m` and both launchers use an **RA73**

## Track S — the world build *(started 2026-08-10, [build-from-source.md](build-from-source.md))*

> **A note on the letter C.** Three different things in this repo have been
> called C, and it has already caused confusion. "Track C" below is
> **ipnx-ports**. B0.6's **C1–C4** are *image and machine configuration*. The
> task list's **C1–C6** are *this* section — building the system from our own
> source. Prefer **S1, S2, …** for these from here on; the task subjects still
> say C and are not worth renumbering mid-flight.

Building Research Unix from the source in `v8/` rather than shipping a disk
image someone else made. This is what makes `v8/` a *source tree* instead of an
archive, and it is the foundation for Track B — you cannot cross-build V10
inside V8 until you can rebuild V8 itself.

Research Unix never had a world build; the stages, the ordering evidence and
the safety rules are in [build-from-source.md](build-from-source.md).

- [x] **S1** Take ownership of the tape as ipnx source — 7,819 files, `MANIFEST`,
      case collisions escaped, `ar` source archives unpacked *(2026-08-10)*
- [x] **S2** Serve it read-only at `/n/src` over netfs, with the escaped names
      resolved server-side — nothing is copied to guest disk *(2026-08-10)*
- [x] **S3** **Stage 1: the bootstrap toolchain builds from our source.** All
      fourteen of `yacc make lex cpp ccom c2 as ld ar ranlib nm size strip cc`,
      compiled off the share into a separate build filesystem. The compiler
      works and agrees with the 1985 one byte-for-byte on the same input
      *(2026-08-10; `tools/drive-stage1.sh`, `work/myv8/c2-stage1.log`)*
- [x] **S4** Stage 2 (libc) then stage 3 (the toolchain again, against it) —
      `same=14 differ=0`, so the system reproduces itself *(2026-08-10)*
- [x] **S5** `cc -B` extended to `as`, `ld`, `crt0.o` **and `libc.a`** — the
      hermeticity gaps *(2026-08-10)*. `-t02palc` seals everything `cc`
      executes; `-t c` also stops it appending `-lc`, which mattered most
      because V8's `ld` has no `-L` and would have resolved the C library out
      of the running system silently. `yaccpar` moved to a **runtime**
      `$YACCPAR` rather than an `#ifndef`, so stage 1's yacc and stage 3's
      stay byte-identical. Verified with the full seal in place:
      `same=14 differ=0`, and `cmp-sealed-vs-oldcc=0` — our `as` and `ld`
      reproduce the tape's output too. Two bugs fell out: libc was being
      compiled by the *tape's* `cc` (the script conflated "which compiler"
      with "which directory"), and the fixpoint test needed the classic
      stage3-vs-stage3b fallback, now in `v8/mk/fixpoint.sh`
- [x] **S6** Stages 4–7: headers, libraries, then everything. Four separate
      pieces, in a forced order, each blocked on the one before:
  - [x] **4** headers — 224 files into `DESTDIR/usr/include`; nothing after
        this compiles against the running system's *(2026-08-10, first run)*
  - [x] **5** libraries — 19 archives (curses, termcap, F77, I77, mp, l, jobs,
        cbt, dbm, dk, g, **in**, and the seven plot libraries); libc is
        stage 2 *(2026-08-11)*. `curses-ok` proves it together with stage 4:
        a program compiled against our headers, linked against our
        `libcurses` and `libtermcap`, and run
  - [~] **6** commands — **193 built, and the target is not what it looked
        like** *(2026-08-11)*. The shipped image carries **381 commands**;
        we install **205** of them. But of the 176 we do not, **147 have no
        source anywhere in the tape** — including **all 34 games**, whose
        binaries ship in `/usr/games` with nothing behind them. So the
        buildable universe is **234**, and 205 of 234 is **88%**, with
        `/bin` — the partition that has to be self-sufficient when `/usr` is
        unmounted — at **50 of 57**.

        The 29 that remain are listed individually in
        `gen/stage6-skipped.txt`. The largest group needs `xstr`: `csh` and
        `ex` both pipe every object through it to share string literals, and
        `strings.o`, which both links, is *produced* by that pass rather than
        compiled. `awk` needs a `maketab` built and run mid-build to generate
        `proctab.c`. Four link archives built inside their own component
        (`map`, `plot`, `view2d`, `asd`), five include headers the tape never
        shipped, and two — `cfront` and `compat` — the 1985 compiler rejects
        outright.

        Detail below, and the original count of "~277" is superseded: it
        counted source directories, not commands the image actually has.

        Composition: 31 hand-written
        (`config`(8), `sh`, the boot path, `nmount`) plus **121 derived** from
        the tree and `v8/mk/where.txt`, plus **the whole toolchain installed
        into `DESTDIR`** — a system with no compiler cannot rebuild itself,
        which is the whole of stage 9. Every install path **measured**:
        `tools/harvest-paths.sh` walks a booted golden image and writes 434
        entries, because the 165 loose `.c` have no makefile of any kind and
        `/bin` vs `/usr/bin` decides whether the system can repair itself with
        `/usr` unmounted. All seven names it had refused to guess (`date`
        `rm` `cat` `ls` `echo` `chmod` `sync`) are `/bin`. The 113 makefile
        directories are read for the two facts only they know — which objects
        and which extra libraries — and 62 derive cleanly.

        **118 are refused, each with a stated reason** in
        `gen/stage6-skipped.txt`, and every rule was written by a build
        failure rather than foreseen: one `main()` or it is not one program
        (`asd` holds five, `refer` twelve, `view2d` thirteen); the directory
        and not just the makefile (`pp` carries a `scan.l` its makefile never
        names); an archive built inside the component (`map`'s `libmap.a`); a
        header the tape does not ship (`sdb`'s `bio.h`, plus three components
        including headers by **absolute path** into a live machine); a source
        that is not C (`csh`'s `doprnt.c` is VAX assembly with cpp
        directives); and a `.c.o` redefined as a multi-step recipe (`csh`'s
        `xstr` string sharing). Two the 1985 compiler simply cannot build are
        refused by name: `cfront` (C++) and `compat`.

        No new library blocks the rest — `-lm` needs nothing at all, since V8
        compiles `math/*.c` straight into `libc.a` — and of every `-l` in the
        113 makefiles only `ether`, `chaos`, `y` and `ln` name something with
        no source in the tree, blocking three directories
  - [x] **7** the kernel — **a 236,520-byte `unix`, built from our source
        with our toolchain** *(2026-08-11)*. `usr/sys/ipnx/conf` is `alice`'s
        VAX-11/780 plus the Internet pseudo-devices `research` had, and it is
        the machine we actually emulate rather than either of the tape's. The
        only stage that copies source, because `config` resolves its inputs as
        `"../conf/"` by string concatenation
- [x] **S7** Stage 8: a disk built from source, **and a boot from it**
      *(2026-08-11)*. `v8/mk/builddisk.sh` makes both filesystems, fills them
      from `DESTDIR`, writes 414 device nodes from `proto-dev` and installs
      the kernel; `tools/boot-newdisk.sh` boots the image **alone** — nothing
      else attached, so nothing missing can be satisfied from another drive —
      and gets the boot block finding `hp(0,0)unix`, the autoconfig, `login:`,
      a root shell, `/usr` mounted, and a C program **compiled and run** by
      the compiler stage 6 installed. Its own prerequisite was booting the
      build machine on our stage-7 kernel (`tools/install-kernel.sh`), because
      stage 8 needs a third drive and no machine description on the tape
      declares more than two. What it still lacked at that point was most of
      `/usr`: 36 files in `/bin`, 73 in `/usr/bin`, and `/etc/rc` reporting
      `cron` and `rmdir` missing — closed by **S10**, which is where the
      difference between "we built it" and "it is on the disk" turned out to
      live
- [x] **S8** Stage 9: the new system rebuilds itself under `chroot` — the point
      at which `v8/` is demonstrably complete *(2026-08-11)*. **9 of 9 tools**,
      rebuilt from source by the compiler stage 6 installed, inside
      `DESTDIR`, with **no `-B` and no `TOOLDIR`**: `yacc make lex cpp ccom c2
      as ld ar ranlib nm size strip cc` and then libc. `v8/mk/buildstage9.sh`.

      V8 has `chroot(2)` — syscall 61 — and ships **no `chroot(1)`**: no
      command on the image, no source in `usr/src`, no manual page. So
      `v8/usr/src/cmd/chroot.c` is ours, and stage 6 installs it as
      `/etc/chroot`. `cc(1)` is why it has to be a real chroot rather than a
      `-B`: `-B` is a *runtime* option, so the `cc` in `DESTDIR` still carries
      `/lib/ccom` as its compiled-in pass directory and, run from outside,
      would silently use the **building** system's passes and report success
      for a `DESTDIR` containing none of them. Under chroot
      `DESTDIR/lib/ccom` *is* `/lib/ccom`, so a missing pass fails instead of
      being borrowed — which is the whole experiment.

      Three things a chroot needs that nothing lists: `/dev/null` (there is no
      `/dev` in `DESTDIR` at all, so every `> /dev/null` reads as a
      permissions problem), a build directory that is not `/` (`//obj9` is
      rejected by V8's `mkdir` on all fourteen components), and the share
      mounted **inside** the new root before entering it
- [x] **S9** Our guest-side patches move into the tree *(2026-08-11)*: the
      `streamio.c` `istread`/`istwrite` rewrite with `strdata` widened from
      512/256 to **8192/4096**, `nmount.c`, and the `il0` kernel config —
      `usr/sys/ipnx/conf` declares `il0 at uba? csr 0164040` plus the `inet`,
      `uarp`, `tcp` and `udp` pseudo-devices. Every kernel stage 7 builds now
      carries all of it by construction, rather than by a driver patching a
      running machine. `chroot.c` (S8) and `date.c`'s 69/70 window joined them
- [x] **S10** **The golden disk is ours, and the TUHS image retires**
      *(2026-08-11; [golden-disk.md](golden-disk.md))*. The disk stops being
      "what we could build" and becomes a complete system: 206 built, **1406
      carried** off the reference image because the tape shipped them without
      source, and the runtime trees installed beside them.

      The gate is not "does our disk equal theirs" — it does not, and should
      not. It is **containment**: every file on the TUHS image is on ours, or
      in git as a `MANIFEST` `source` row, or named individually as
      deliberately regenerated. `tools/retire-check.py` decides it, and while
      one file is left over it fails.

      Two tools made this cheap enough to do at all. `tools/v8fs.py` reads a
      V8 filesystem out of a SIMH image **from macOS**, so "what is actually
      on that disk?" stopped meaning "boot a VAX and read `find` off a serial
      line". And stage 8's `cp`-per-file loop became one `cpio -p` fed by a
      generated manifest: 22 MB in six seconds, where 400 copies had been the
      slowest thing in the stage.

      `tools/mkcarry.py` generates the three lists and, for the 2264 runtime
      files, **sha256-compares the image's copy against ours** — 2263 match,
      so they come off the mounted disk instead of over netfs, which costs a
      round trip per file and would have taken ninety minutes. The one that
      differs comes from `/n/src`. It is a proof, not a shortcut, and it is
      re-run every time the lists are regenerated.

      Four files were found missing that no boot test could have caught, each
      a different way for a build to lie about itself: `bcd` built into
      `DESTDIR/usr/games` with `usr/games` absent from stage 8's copy list;
      `yacc` and `strip` installed to `TOOLDIR/bin`, reaching the toolchain
      and never `/usr/bin` — where `where.txt`, the image and our own
      `provenance.txt` all say they belong, and where `mkdep.py`'s generated
      makefiles default `YACCPATH` to look; and `wmux`, ours from A4, which no
      `MANIFEST` row describes and no generated list picks up.

      **Done.** The whole pipeline reran from bare source — `STAGE1` through
      `STAGE9-CHROOT`, 193 commands with zero failures, a 236,672-byte kernel,
      and the fixpoint holding at `same=14 differ=0` after the `yacc`/`strip`
      move. `retire-check` reports **UNIQUE 0**; `boot-newdisk` boots the image
      alone and passes all thirteen checks. `image/ipnx-v8-rp07.img.tar.bz2` is
      in git at **11.1 MB**.

      And the loop is closed: `carry.txt` regenerated from **our** disk gives
      the same 1405 paths as from the TUHS one, so the reference now defaults
      to ours and the build's only external input is the tapes

## Track C — ipnx-ports *(declared 2026-08-10; nothing built)*

A ports tree in this repository, in the spirit of FreeBSD's: one recipe per package —
upstream distfile, patch series, build and install rules — for bringing contemporary
software back to a 1985 machine. The patch series **is** the artifact; the target has
K&R C with no prototypes, 14-byte filenames, no shared libraries and no POSIX, so a
port is an act of translation and has to be readable as one.

- [ ] **P0** Decide the shape: `ports/<category>/<name>/{Makefile,distinfo,patches/}`,
      what fetches (host side) and what builds (guest side), and how a port crosses
      the ingest path — courier disk today, netfs after N5–N7
- [ ] **P1** `libcompat` — smaller than first assumed, because V8's libc was *measured*
      rather than guessed (`tools/v8-libc-probe.exp`): `strchr`, `memcpy`, `memset` and
      `qsort` are already there, and `bcopy`/`bzero` are the ones missing. What is
      actually needed is a prototype-eliding macro, seven functions (`strtol`, `strtod`,
      `strstr`, `memmove`, `atexit`, `vprintf`, `vfprintf` — several liftable from V10's
      own `libc/gen/`), and `bcopy`/`bzero` wrappers
      ([v11-plan.md](v11-plan.md) *"The real cost"*)
- [ ] **P2** First entries: **V10's own games that V8 lacks** (`adv`, `boggle`,
      `doctor`, `morse`, `pacman`, `rain`, `trek`, `wump`, …). Same copyright estate,
      same compiler, no licence question — so the machinery gets debugged on work
      that cannot fail for interesting reasons
- [ ] **P3** Same trick for the **languages already sitting in the V10 tree**:
      Berkeley Pascal is complete there (`cmd/pascal/{pi,px,pxp,pc0,libpc,eyacc}`),
      Fortran is Feldman's own `f77` with `libF77`/`libI77`, and there are `hoc`,
      `icon`, `sml`, `spitbol`, `snocone`, `matlab`, `bc`/`dc`. None of these is a
      port; they are builds
- [ ] **P4** First true port, from 4.4BSD-Lite provenance: `robots` or `worms`
- [ ] **P5** **Franz Lisp** — the real one. `man/mana/lisp.1` proves `lisp`, `liszt`
      and `lxref` ran on the Research machines, but the source is *not* in the tree,
      and Franz Lisp was VAX-native, so it fits this hardware better than almost
      anything else available. Licence is ambiguous (Berkeley origin, distributed with
      BSD, later commercialised by Franz Inc.) — settle it before starting
- [ ] **P6** `gcc` — V10 carries `cmd/gcc/` (145 files, an early 1.x). An ANSI compiler
      on this machine is the key that unlocks everything written after 1989, so it is
      worth knowing whether it builds long before anything depends on it
- [ ] **P7** Reproducibility: a port builds the same way on a fresh golden image

**Out of reach for now: S.** John Chambers', Rick Becker's and Allan Wilks' statistical
language belongs on these machines more than almost anything — it *was* on them — but
Bell Labs gave StatSci an exclusive licence in 1993 and it passed to Insightful and then
TIBCO in 2008. It is not covered by the 2017 covenant and no free source exists. R is
GPL but is a 1993 reimplementation wanting ANSI C, Fortran and far more memory than a
780 has. Both stay open questions rather than plans; **S would need someone at TIBCO to
say yes**, and that is a letter to write, not a task to schedule.

## Track D — ipnx-v11 *(speculative; behind V10, deliberately)*

The Eleventh Edition that never existed. Scope framing and evidence:
[v11-plan.md](v11-plan.md). Nothing is committed and nothing starts before B4.

The admission rule is one question — **does this change the system's model of itself?**
Sockets and vnodes do, and are refused; programs do not. Track D is the *editorial*
track (what belongs in the edition); Track C is the *mechanism* (how anything gets
built). The games are chosen here and built there.

**DECISION CHANGED 2026-08-17: the language is ANSI C and there is ONE compiler.**
This line used to refuse "a wholesale ANSI libc" alongside sockets and vnodes. It is
reversed on Christine's direction — but the *mess stays in V10*, which is a restoration
and must stay authentic; standardising is V11's job, not V10's. B2's measurements are
why the reversal is the easier reading rather than a concession:

- V10 **was never built from scratch**. It accreted, and the tape shows it: the
  `libc/mkfile` that produced the shipped `libc.a` names `cc` for members that only
  `lcc` can compile, and 25 of the 261 are ANSI (`int fprintf(FILE *f, const char
  *fmt, ...)`, `void *`, `size_t`, `<stdarg.h>`). The tree carries **two generations
  of stdio at once** — the K&R `doprnt.c`/`doscan.c` set that `omakefile` builds, and
  the ANSI `_dtoa`/`vfprintf`/`snprintf` set the archive actually contains.
- So V10's per-file compiler requirement is **mixed and undocumented**, and no
  makefile on the tape is a reliable guide to which file needs which. Restoring V10
  means living with that; V11 is where it stops.

V11 therefore converts the tree to ANSI C throughout and compiles it with the Plan 9
compiler, so there is **one** language and **one** compiler and the question never has
to be asked per file again.

- [ ] **D-A1** Settle the compiler. **Plan 9 DID target the VAX-11/750 — the same
      machine we emulate** — and an earlier version of this item said the opposite.
      From the Plan 9 wiki's [Other hardware](https://9p.io/wiki/plan9/Other_hardware/index.html)
      page, verbatim:

      > Vax 750 - The earliest file server port. The compiler binary was recently found
      > but the source appears to have been lost in the mists of time.

      The *released* editions dropped the target, which is why neither Ken Thompson's
      [Plan 9 C Compilers](https://9p.io/sys/doc/compiler.html) (`v` MIPS, `k` SPARC,
      `8` i386, `2` 68020/68040, `x` AT&T 3210, `9` i960, `z` Hobbit) nor
      [The Various Ports](https://9p.io/sys/doc/port.html) lists it. **Two primary
      sources agreeing on a negative did not make it true**: absence from the released
      suite is not absence from history. Recorded because the reasoning was sound and
      the conclusion was wrong.

      What that changes, and what it does not:
      - **Provenance, not existence, is now the constraint.** A recovered *binary* with
        no source cannot be the standard compiler of an edition built from source —
        that is the entire argument of stages 1–3. It would be a fine **oracle**,
        exactly as V10's prebuilt `ccom` and `as` are.
      - **Open, and worth answering before choosing:** does that binary survive
        anywhere fetchable, what does it accept, and does a 1980s Plan 9 VAX compiler
        even have a C dialect V11 would want?
      - Until then the only ANSI VAX compiler we actually hold is `lcc`, which **is**
        buildable from source: front end `cmd/lcc/c/` (18 sources matching `gen3`'s
        objects), VAX back end `gen3/gen.c` + `gen2/vax/`, preprocessor `cmd/lcc/ph/`.
      - There is still **no Plan 9 compiler in the V10 tarball** — no `1c`/`2c`/`5c`/
        `8c`/`vc`/`kc`/`qc` by directory or grep; its Plan 9 lineage is `cmd/u9fs` (9P)
        and `cmd/mk`.
      - The symmetry is worth keeping in view: Plan 9's first file server ran on a
        VAX-11/750 and ipnx's V10 runs on an emulated VAX-11/750, so the *hardware*
        target lines up exactly. That makes this a restoration question, not only a
        retarget question — and if the compiler binary is fetchable it may belong to
        Track B's world sooner than to V11's.
- [ ] **D-A4** **Reconstruct a VAX back end for the Plan 9 compiler**, then port V10's
      source to it (Christine, 2026-08-17). This is the route that keeps V11 on the VAX
      *and* gets the standard compiler, rather than trading one for the other — and it
      is plausible work rather than a wish, because a Plan 9 back end is a small,
      well-bounded thing and the references are all in hand:
      - **Plan 9 back ends are deliberately tiny.** Thompson's
        [Plan 9 C Compilers](https://9p.io/sys/doc/compiler.html) splits each compiler
        into a shared front end plus a per-architecture code generator, which is why the
        suite carries seven of them; writing an eighth is the intended way to add a
        machine.
      - **VAX code generation is already answered twice over, in source we own.** V8's
        `ccom` (`usr/src/cmd/pcc2/`) and V10's own `cmd/ccom/vax/` are complete,
        working, *readable* VAX code generators — `gencode.c`, `genaux.c`, `genmore.c`,
        `local.c` — and `libc/sys/*.s` plus `cmd/as/instrs` fix the instruction
        encodings and calling convention exactly. So the machine description does not
        have to be rediscovered; it has to be re-expressed.
      - `lcc`'s own VAX back end (`gen3/gen.c`, `gen2/vax/`) is a third reference, and a
        closer structural analogue since lcc also separates front end from generator.
      - Order matters: **back end first, then the port.** A converted tree with no
        compiler to check it against is unverifiable, whereas a back end can be tested
        against V10's existing binaries the moment it emits anything.
      - The recovered VAX compiler binary from D-A1, if fetchable, is the oracle for
        this: something to compare output against rather than something to depend on.
- [ ] **D-A2** Inventory what conversion actually costs: how many of V10's ~283 command
      units and 261 libc members are K&R, and how many already are not. `tools/`
      already has the scanner shape for this (`v10-syscalls.py`, `v10-proto.py`).
- [ ] **D-A3** Convert libc first, for the same reason stage 2 comes before stage 3:
      everything links against it.

Reconnaissance (2026-08-10) found that much of this is **restoration, not importation**:
V10's own tree carries `cmd/u9fs/` (an original-9P file server — `Tclone`, `Tclwalk`,
`NAMELEN` 28), `cmd/mk/`, and a netfs explicitly designed to take any protocol library.

- [ ] **D0** Licensing pass *first*: Plan 9 is MIT since March 2021 (Plan 9 Foundation),
      so that half is clean. A v11 image still mixes estates and that must be answered
      before code
- [ ] **D1** Build `cmd/u9fs` as it stands and see what it does — the cheapest possible
      probe of the whole thread
- [ ] **D2** Restore `sam`'s host side. There is **no `cmd/sam/`** in the V10 tarball —
      only the 630 terminal half, the man page and the paper. plan9port's sam is MIT and
      the terminal half is already on the disk, so there is a live target from day one
- [ ] **D3** `rc` — Duff's shell; small, self-contained, the absence felt daily
- [ ] **D4** Later, if at all: `acme` on the 5620 (genuinely interesting), `plumber`

**Deferred to Track B, deliberately.** Whether netfs's successor should be **9P** rather
than a documented netb is a real fork in the road, and N4–N7 will reach it — but it is
not worth resolving now, with V10 unbuilt and the interface unrebuilt. Take the netb
route on the N track, keep 9P in view, and decide when Track B is actually there.

**Inferno: parked as a maybe, depending on licensing.** Its estate runs Lucent → Vita
Nuova with GPLv2 and MIT at different points, and until that is settled per component
there is nothing to plan. Note for whoever picks it up: it splits cleanly — **Styx is
9P**, so protocol interoperability needs no VM at all and folds into D1; **Dis and
Limbo** are a research question and plausibly their own edition rather than part of
this one.

## Post-1.0 (unscheduled)

- [ ] Original 68000 Blit mode (Musashi core; requires ROM permission resolution)
- [ ] Emscripten web demo — the first browser VAX. *The emulator compiled to WASM — the
      opposite of ipnx-v12, which has no VAX at all*
- [ ] V10-era networking exploration (DEQNA/IP)

## This roadmap ends at V11

**There is no v12 track and there will not be one.** What would have been a twelfth edition
— Research Unix retargeted with no emulated 11/780 underneath — turned out not to be a
retarget at all once the surviving code was counted: `io/`, `vm/`, `md/` and `ml/` do not
cross, leaving roughly 3,300 lines of process semantics out of 61,072. That is a rewrite,
and a rewrite is not a restoration.

It continues as a separate project with a separate premise — a modified Plan 9 kernel hosted
as a userspace process, a V10 personality, WebAssembly executables — at
[**ipnx-v12**](https://github.com/ChristineTham/ipnx-v12). The reasoning is set out in
[the README](../README.md#where-this-project-ends) and the design in that repository's
`docs/v12-plan.md`.

Everything above this line stays here and stays in the old tradition.
