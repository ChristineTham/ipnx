# Configuring the machine: from a generic V8 image to a usable ipnx

**Status: built, 2026-08-12.** All three stages are in the tree; the checklist
at the end records what is verified and what is not.

**The design decision below changed in the doing, and for the better.** This
document proposed a build-time script run against the
golden image on the workbench. That is not where it ended up. The build now
generates the disk from source, so everything universal lives in `v8/etc/`
and is *copied* by `builddisk.sh`: the identity, the motd, the profiles, the
mount points. A script that mutates an image afterwards is strictly worse
than a source file the build reads, because only one of them is reproducible.

That change is also how this went wrong for a while, and the failure is worth
recording. That script existed and had been run against the *old workbench*
image, so the configured values were real — on that image. `v8/etc/whoami`
still held the tape's `v8generic`, `v8/etc/motd` still held the 1985 joke, and
`v8/etc/ttys` still described alice's 24 lines with six of ours disabled. The
build faithfully copied all three. Nothing caught it: `retire-check.py`
compares against the TUHS image and cannot see that something of *ours* is
unset. `tools/config-audit.py` is the check that closes that gap.

## The goal

A V8 machine somebody can actually live in, not a demo that boots to `login:`
and impresses for ten minutes. Concretely: it knows its own name, it has an
account that belongs to the person running it, it can see the host's files, and
it is on the network — all without the user typing a single configuration
command.

## Why one script is not enough

It operated on `rp06v8.golden` on the desktop workbench, and
what it writes is baked into the image every copy of the app ships. That is the
right home for anything true of *every* installation. It is the wrong home for
anything true of *this* installation, and the personalisation the goal asks for
is squarely the second kind: the host account's name is not known when the
image is built, and cannot be.

So the work splits in two, and the split is the main design decision here.

**Build time — the identity pass on the workbench.** Runs once
on the workbench against the golden image. Universal, auditable, and cheap to
re-run when the image is rebuilt. Everything that does not depend on who is
running the app.

**First boot — a provisioner in the app.** Runs once per installation, against
the working disk in Application Support, the first time it boots. The app
already drives V8 over the console channel and knows how to wait for `login:`
and `# ` (`Machine.swift`, `ConsoleLink.swift`); the provisioner is that same
mechanism used deliberately rather than only for boot detection. A marker file
beside `v8.disk` records that it has run, so it never runs twice, and a `Reset
disk` in Settings clears it along with everything else.

There is a tempting third option — put the settings on the `rp1` courier disk
and have `/etc/rc` read them — and
it is worth keeping in reserve. It is more machinery than twenty lines of shell
typed once justifies, but it becomes the better answer if first-boot
configuration ever grows past that.

## Stage 1 — identity and an account (no new dependencies)

**The identity pass**, build time. Absorbed the three fix-*.exp scripts, all
of which are one-shot repairs that should have been one script:

- `/etc/whoami` = `ipnx-v8`. This is the *only* place V8 keeps the system name:
  there is no `hostname(1)`, no `uname(1)`, no `/etc/systemid`, and `/etc/rc`
  never sets one. `login` reads it, which is why it appears above the prompt.
- `/etc/motd` — the licensing position this project runs under, not the 1985
  joke. Verbatim as it stands today.
- `/.profile` — `PATH` including `/usr/games` and `/usr/jerq/bin`, `TERM=dmd`,
  `stty erase ^H kill ^U intr ^C`, and a `fortune`. V8 ships no `/.profile`,
  `/.login` or `/etc/profile` at all, which is why `vi` used to die with `TERM`
  unset. **Erase stays at ^H** — the app maps Delete to 0x08, so ^H is what
  that key sends.
- `lost+found` on `/` and `/usr` via `/etc/mklost+found`, so an autoboot `fsck`
  that has to reconnect an orphan does not abort to single-user.
- `/etc/skel/.profile` — the same shape as root's, minus the root-only bits, so
  a new account gets a working environment.
- The mount points `/n`, `/n/macos`, `/n/home` — empty directories, harmless
  until something mounts on them.

**The account**, first boot, in the app. Named after the host account
(`NSUserName()` on macOS; on iOS there is no such thing, so the app asks once,
defaulting to something neutral). What it does:

- append a `/etc/passwd` line with a real V8 home at `/usr/<user>` and
  `/bin/sh`; V8 has no `adduser`, and `/etc/passwd` is plain text
- `mkdir /usr/<user>`, copy `/etc/skel/.profile` in, `chown`
- no password initially — this is a personal machine emulating a personal
  machine, and a password prompt with no way to recover it is a support burden
  with no security value on a disk the user already owns. Settings can offer to
  set one.

Names need care: V8's login name field is 8 characters and its **filenames are
14 bytes** (this predates 4.2BSD long names), so a host account called
`christie.tham` has to be truncated deterministically, and the app should show
what it chose rather than silently mangling it.

### Why the host share must not be the home directory

The instinct is to point the new account's home at the host's home directory
and be done. It does not survive contact:

- **14-byte filenames.** Anything longer is not representable. A real macOS
  home directory is full of longer names, and the failure is silent truncation
  and collision, not an error.
- **Case.** macOS is case-insensitive by default; V8 is not. `Makefile` and
  `makefile` are one file on one side and two on the other.
- **`login` chdirs to the home directory** and falls back to `/` when it
  cannot. A home directory that only exists when a network mount is up means a
  login before the mount silently lands somewhere else.
- **Dot-files would be shared.** `.profile` written by V8, read by a host shell
  that does not speak its `stty` syntax, is a booby trap in both directions.

So: a real V8 home at `/usr/<user>`, and the host visible *beside* it at
`/n/macos` (the whole share) and `/n/home` (the user's own directory). `/n` is
the name the V8/V10 lineage already uses for attached name spaces, so this is
the house convention rather than an invention.

## Stage 2 — the network up at boot (depends on N3 landing in the image)

N3 proved a V8 kernel with the Interlan NI1010 driver (`il0`) reaching the real
Internet through SIMH's SLiRP NAT — sandbox-safe, so it works on iOS too
([n-track-notes.md](n-track-notes.md)). The shipped image does **not** have that
kernel yet; it still runs the stock one. To make networking a default rather
than an experiment:

- rebuild the golden image around the N3 kernel (this is the gating step, and
  it is also what N0's RP07 migration wants, so the two should happen together)
- `att il0 nat:...` in the app's `boot.conf` **and** `resume.conf`
- `/etc/rc`: bring `il0` up and add the default route. Remember V8 is
  **classful** — the interface's network is `10.0.0.0`, not SLiRP's `10.0.2.0`;
  that one number cost N3 a debugging session
- resolver configuration for `dnsq`, in whatever form V8 expects — to be
  confirmed against the source, not from memory
- Settings: a switch to turn networking off, off by default is wrong here but
  the switch should exist

## Stage 3 — the host's files (depends on N4–N7)

netfs over TCP is the route: its in-kernel client is already `standard` in every
V8 kernel and its mount takes any file descriptor. The wire format is in
[netfs-protocol.md](netfs-protocol.md), the host server is `netfs/`, and the app
compiles the same sources (`FileShare.swift`).

Once that exists, first boot adds to `/etc/rc`:

- `/n/macos` — a host directory the user picks, sandbox-scoped
- `/n/home` — the user's home directory, same mechanism

Both read-only first. Write access to a real home directory from a 1985 kernel
with 14-byte filenames deserves its own decision, taken once the read path has
been living for a while.

On iOS the same server runs in-process against the app's own documents
directory, which is what makes "Files integration" and "the host share" the
same feature rather than two.

## Checklist

Superseded by the source tree rather than done as written:

- [x] ~~Fold the three `fix-*.exp` into `work/config.exp`~~ — the values live
      in `v8/etc/{whoami,motd,profile.root,profile.skel,ttys}` and the build
      copies them. `config.exp` is retired; a script that patches an image
      after the fact cannot be reproduced from the repo.

Done and verified by `tools/config-audit.py` (0 config differences against the
configured reference):

- [x] `/etc/skel/.profile`, and the `/n`, `/n/macos`, `/n/home` mount points
- [x] `/etc/whoami` = `ipnx-v8`; `/etc/motd` = the licensing position
- [x] `/etc/ttys` enables `tty00`..`tty07` — all eight lines the app opens
- [x] `lost+found` on `/` and `/usr`
- [x] The golden image carries the N3 kernel: `ilrint` is in `/unix`, and the
      config declares `il0` plus the `inet`/`tcp`/`udp` pseudo-devices. This
      was the blocking item and it had already been cleared without the doc
      noticing.
- [x] `/dev/il0` and `/dev/il1`, char major 44 — the driver was compiled in
      and there was no node for `ipconfig` to open
- [x] `set il enable` / `attach il nat:` in both the app's configs
- [x] `/etc/rc` brings `il0` up: `ipconfig`, `tcpconfig` onto `/dev/ip6`, and
      the default route, all guarded on the device node existing
- [x] First-boot provisioner: `Provisioner.swift` + `Session.provisionIfNeeded`
- [x] Name truncation (8-char login, 14-byte filenames), deterministic, and
      the chosen name is reported rather than silently applied
- [x] Two shares — `/n/macos` and `/n/home` — each its own server and port,
      with Settings sections for both

- [x] `/n/macos` and `/n/home` mounted from `/etc/rc` at boot, backgrounded and
      silenced so a share the user has not chosen does not delay a boot
- [x] Verified end to end on a booted machine (2026-08-15). The app seeded the
      new golden, and afterwards the working disk holds:

	/usr/inet/lib/hosts	10.0.2.15  ipnx-v8 v8
				10.0.2.2   gateway
	/usr/inet/lib/networks	10.0.0.0   slirp-net
	/usr/christie/.profile	owned by uid 1000
	/bin/uname, /usr/bin/ipnxfetch

      The `hosts` and `networks` files are the proof that matters for the
      network: `/etc/rc` writes them only inside `if test -c /dev/il0`, so
      their presence means the node existed and the card was attached.

Resolved since (2026-08-16) — each executed and confirmed, not merely assumed:

- [x] Resolver configuration for `dnsq`, confirmed against the source.
      `v8/usr/src/cmd/dnsq.c` defines `RESOLV "/usr/inet/lib/resolv"` and
      `resolver()` reads one address out of it, falling back to SLiRP's
      forwarder; `/etc/rc` writes `10.0.2.3` there when `/dev/il0` exists.
      Proven end to end rather than by reading: `tools/net-selftest.sh`
      resolves `www.tuhs.org` to 50.116.15.146 on the second query — the
      first is expected to lose to ARP, which is why the harness asks twice.
- [x] Settings: a switch to turn networking off — `SettingsView`'s
      **Machine → Ethernet card (NI1010)** toggle, which gates the
      `set il enable` / `attach il nat:` pair in both configs. `/etc/rc`
      guards on `/dev/il0`, so a machine with the card off boots exactly as
      it did before the N track, rather than hanging on a missing interface.

Deliberately not done:

- **An optional account password.** Not an omission — a decision, recorded in
  `Provisioner.swift`: this is a personal machine emulating a personal machine,
  on a disk its owner already has in their hands, so *"a password prompt with
  no recovery path is a support burden with no security value."* The account is
  created with an empty password field and `tty01` logs itself in. If it is
  ever wanted, Settings is where it goes; nothing in the machine blocks it.
