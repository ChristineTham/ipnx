# Phase A0 — spike results (session 1, 2026-08-08)

**Bottom line: the V8 appliance works end-to-end on this Mac.** Classic SIMH 3.12-5 built
clean, myv8 produced the RP06 image in ~2.5 minutes, V8 boots to multiuser, and a scripted
DZ-line session logged in, listed `/proc`, compiled and ran C, and started `mux` far enough
to capture its terminal-identification handshake. The only unfinished leg is a real terminal
emulator on the other end of the wire — blocked by a machine constraint (no package
manager), with a clear path forward.

*The `work/` harnesses named below were scratch files and were never committed; `work/`
itself is the gitignored workbench the V8 tooling still uses.*

## What was proven

| Step | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| SIMH build | `simhv312-5.zip` → `make vax780` in the `sim/` subdir; **warnings only** on modern clang | `work/simh312/sim/BIN/vax780` (639 KB) |
| V8 install | `./setup` ran unattended to "Done." | `work/myv8/setup.log`; `rp06v8` + `rp06bsd` (174 MB each), **~2.5 min wall clock** |
| Boot | `vax780 run.conf` → single-user `# ` shell, no prompts; `^D` → multiuser with DZ gettys | `work/myv8/boot.log` |
| DZ login | `login: root` (no password) over telnet :8888 | full Eighth Edition motd ("a trolley car is certain to grow in your stomach…") |
| System alive | `ps`, **`ls /proc`** (populated!), `cc h.c && a.out` → "hello from V8" | `work/dztalk.py` transcript |
| Terminal software | `/usr/jerq/bin` (5620: mux, 32ld, jim, crabs, proof, paint…) and `/usr/blit/bin` (68K: mpx, 68ld…) both installed | ls output in transcript |
| mux handshake | `/usr/jerq/bin/mux` emits **`ESC [ c`** (hex `1b 5b 63`, a Device Attributes query) and waits for the terminal's identification — exactly what a 5620 with 8;7;3 firmware answers | dztalk mux-poke capture |

## Measurements

- **Install**: ~2.5 min for the full 4.1BSD → V8 chain (Apple Silicon).
- **Serial pacing**: no artificial throttling observed under classic 3.12-5 — compiles and
  directory listings render instantly over the DZ. The community's "17-minute muxterm load"
  appears specific to newer SIMH's realistic line-speed emulation. Definitive mux download
  timing still requires a real terminal emulator.
- **Idle CPU**: `vax780` sits at **~97% of one core while V8 is idle**. Idle
  detection/throttling is mandatory for the iPad app (research risk confirmed).

## Environment gotchas discovered (runbook corrected)

1. **No Homebrew on this machine.** The runbook's `brew install …` prerequisites were
   wrong for this host. Stock macOS provides `expect` (all myv8 needs). There is **no
   telnet client**; `work/dztalk.py` (Python, handles IAC negotiation) replaces it.
2. **A shell-pipeline trap**: `brew install … | tail` masked the "command not found" —
   the SDL2 "install" silently did nothing. Check exit codes of the *first* pipe stage.
3. **Mark parity on first contact**: V8's getty sends the initial `login:` prompt with the
   parity bit set (`lo\xe7i\xee:`); byte-matchers must strip bit 7 until after login.
4. **`mux` is not on root's PATH** — invoke `/usr/jerq/bin/mux`.
5. The simh zip unpacks into a `sim/` subdirectory (the makefile lives there).

## Remaining for A0

*(All resolved — Sessions 2–6 below. The terminal leg landed as the headless `dmdbridge`
cargo binary; timing is measured; the one deferral is re-verifying under **open-simh +
`set noasync`**, which moves to A1 where open-simh gets built as the app's library.)*

## Session 2 (2026-08-08, later): the headless dmd_core bridge

**Built and working**: [tools/dmdbridge](../tools/dmdbridge) — a Rust binary embedding
`dmd_core` (pinned git rev) that connects to SIMH's DZ telnet line, handles IAC, strips
mark parity, auto-logs-in, starts `/usr/jerq/bin/mux`, paces bytes into the DUART, dumps
the 800×1024 framebuffer to PNGs, and drives scripted mouse gestures. The full state
machine (login → shell → mux → download) runs unattended. This is the iPad app's terminal
embedding, prototyped.

**Timing measurements (the spike's core question, now fully answered):**

- SIMH does **no** serial throttling (3.12-5's tmxr has zero speed support). The pacing
  lives in **dmd_core's DUART**, which delays per-character in *wall-clock* time at the
  programmed baud.
- A factory-fresh 5620 (empty NVRAM) runs its host port at the 1984 default of **1200
  baud** → measured **156 B/s** sustained. muxterm is **144,603 bytes** → full download
  ≈ **15.5 minutes**. *That* is the community's "17-minute" number, reproduced from first
  principles — it was never SIMH.
- Turbo experiment (local `delay_rate ÷ 8` patch ≈ 9600-baud equivalent, the real
  hardware's supported speed): sustained **~1,100–1,230 B/s** → full download would be
  ≈ 2 minutes. A ÷64 attempt destabilized the firmware — **app guidance: pace the wire at
  hardware-realistic 9600/19200 equivalent, not unthrottled.**

**The 8;7;3 firmware requirement, mechanically explained** (new finding): dmd_core's
GitHub HEAD embeds only the **8;7;5** ROM. With V8's `32ld` download, that ROM
deterministically executes **`MOVTRW`** (a WE32100 MMU-translation instruction) at
PC=0x496c ~30 KB into the transfer — which dmd_core's CPU doesn't implement → panic.
Patching MOVTRW as identity-translation advances execution *into the downloaded code*
(PC in RAM), which then hits an **unaligned word access** — legal on real WE32100 silicon,
unimplemented in dmd_core. So "use firmware 8;7;3" is not protocol lore: **8;7;3 simply
avoids WE32100 corner-cases that dmd_core never needed for SVR3.** Two viable paths:

1. **Obtain the genuine 8;7;3 ROM image** (Sark's 2022 dump, per the TUHS thread) and
   swap it into `rom_lo.rs`/`rom_hi.rs` — the community-proven configuration. ← preferred
2. Finish dmd_core's WE32100 fidelity (MOVTRW semantics from the manual + unaligned
   access support) and upstream it to Seth Morabito.

**Experiment state** (gitignored): `work/dmd_core` = patched checkout (÷8 turbo,
MOVTRW-identity); `tools/dmdbridge/.cargo/config.toml` redirects the build to it — delete
that file to build pristine. `work/turbo-run.sh` = one-shot run-with-cleanup harness.

## Session 3 (2026-08-08, evening): the 8;7;3 ROM — found, fixed, nearly there

**The ROM hunt succeeded.** The dmdmtg GitHub mirrors are stale (pre-2022); the canonical
repos live on Seth Morabito's Gitea (`git.loomcom.com/seth/{dmd_core,dmd_gtk,dmd_sdl}` —
the HTML is bot-walled but `git clone` and the Gitea API work). Canonical `dmd_core` 0.7.1
(rev `ee222b68`) embeds **both** firmwares — `Dmd::reset(1)` = 8;7;3, `reset(2)` = 8;7;5 —
and the bridge now builds against it ([tools/dmdbridge/Cargo.toml](../tools/dmdbridge/Cargo.toml)).

**Three real emulator bugs found and fixed** (patches:
[tools/dmdbridge/patches/dmd_core-spike-patches.diff](../tools/dmdbridge/patches/dmd_core-spike-patches.diff),
applied to a local checkout via the gitignored `.cargo/config.toml` redirect; all are
upstream-PR candidates):

1. **8;7;3 power-on hang**: the ROM's walking-bit DUART loopback self-test ends each
   sequence with a BREAK — which a real UART receives as a 0x00 data byte plus error flags.
   The core set the flags but never delivered the byte, so the ROM retried the self-test
   forever ("RAM TEST" frozen on screen). Diagnosed by single-stepping with an added
   `ir_debug()`; fixed by delivering the byte. **The 8;7;3 terminal now boots fully** and
   renders the V8 login session (screenshot captured).
2. **Keyboard overrun**: the kb FIFO is 3-deep and wall-clock-paced; typing faster than
   ~a few ms/key silently drops keystrokes mid-word. Bridge now types at 100 ms/key.
3. **CPU pacing**: the DUART is a wall-clock state machine; a flat-out CPU races its
   service deadlines nondeterministically. Bridge now paces the WE32100 to ~10 MHz
   (exactly what Seth's SDL frontend does).

Also confirmed: 8;7;5 hits the `MOVTRW` wall on the canonical core too — **8;7;3 is
mandatory for V8**, now understood three levels deep.

**Where it stands — one wall left**: with 8;7;3 booted and typing fixed, `mux`'s download
runs and stalls **deterministically at 55,138 bytes (38%)**, reproduced twice at the exact
same byte. Prime suspect, with direct evidence: the terminal signals `32ld` block/segment
boundaries by sending a **BREAK to the host**, and `dmd_core`'s `CR_START_BRK` handler
contains literally `TODO: We may want to expose a BREAK condition to the outside world` —
the outgoing break is dropped, so V8 waits forever. **Next session**: surface the outgoing
break (core patch → bridge translates it to telnet `IAC BREAK` toward SIMH; verify classic
SIMH's tmxr delivers inbound breaks to the DZ), then the mux desktop should appear.

The inbound half is already plumbed: `rs232_break()` added to the core, and the bridge
translates telnet `IAC BREAK` (243) into it, in-order.

### Session 4 addendum — the 55,138-byte stall fully diagnosed

Deep instrumentation (DUART state dump + command-byte ring + V8-side probes mid-stall)
turned the stall from a mystery into a three-party deadlock with a named culprit:

- **The stall is not a death.** With stderr captured, host-side `mux` is *alive and
  blocked* at stall time (earlier "getty respawned" observations were later-stage timeouts).
- **Terminal side**: phase-1 load (`0x80|seq`-framed 128-byte packets, per
  `/usr/jerq/src/32ld/proto.h` read off the V8 disk) completes ~55 KB ≈ muxterm's first
  segment; the downloaded second stage runs (PC in RAM), sends its `0xc0`-framed
  relocation packet, toggles its transmitter off (command ring: `…04,08,04,08`), and waits.
  Its ISR shows **delta-break bits pending** — it is waiting for a **BREAK**.
- **Host side**: V8's `mux` sends that BREAK at the phase boundary via the DZ's
  transmit-break bit — and **SIMH's DZ discards it: `TDR_V_TBR "xmit break - NI"`** (not
  implemented, verified in pdp11_dz.c). Terminal waits for a break that never comes; host
  waits for a reply that never comes.
- The kernel-config theory was eliminated (the `alice` config has `mesg 128`, `sp`,
  `connld` — everything mux needs; the zero-grep was a stripped kernel). A
  `disable_tx`-flag-semantics experiment was tried and reverted (breaks the ROM's normal
  typing path both ways it can be scoped).

**The fix for next session** (small and precise): implement DZ transmit-break in the local
SIMH — in `dz_wr`, on a rising TBR bit, emit telnet `IAC BRK` on that line (mind tmxr's
IAC escaping) — and the bridge's existing inbound plumbing (`IAC BRK` → `rs232_break()`)
delivers it to the terminal. This also explains why loomcom's own tests work: the dmd
frontends attach via pty/real tty, where breaks propagate natively; the telnet path is the
only one that loses them.

Also hard-won this session: rebuild the disk with `./setup y` if boots get flaky, keep
`rp06v8.golden` for instant restore, and wait for port 8888 to leave TIME_WAIT between
rapid SIMH restarts (`lsof -i :8888`).

**Session 5 correction — break theory falsified by direct test.** DZ transmit-break was
implemented in the local SIMH (patch: `tools/dmdbridge/patches/simh-dz-txbreak.diff` —
rising TBR edges → raw telnet `IAC BRK`, bypassing tmxr's IAC doubling) and the bridge's
inbound plumbing verified. Result: **mux never sets the TBR bits** — no break flows in
either direction at the stall; the terminal ISR's delta-break bits were stale artifacts of
the self-test loopback patch. Both break hypotheses are now dead. The stall stands as: host
`mux` blocked reading, second stage spinning at PC ~0x720af6–0x720b39 after its
`c0 02 06 03 de 61` message, TX disabled by its own final command. Next candidates, in
order: (1) single-step the second stage's spin loop with `ir_debug()` to name the exact
register/value it polls (same technique that cracked the self-test); (2) run Seth's dmd_gtk
against this same SIMH via a pty↔telnet bridge to bisect transport vs. emulator vs. bridge;
(3) inspect V8-side mux's open fds/wait channel via /proc at stall. A login-retry loop was
added to the bridge (intermittent keystroke loss makes runs a coin flip — root cause still
open in the kb path). Bridge run logs: `work/run*.log`.

## Session 6 (2026-08-09): there was no stall — mux works end-to-end

Candidate (1) — single-stepping the "stalled" second stage with `ir_debug()` — closed the
case in one run, by revealing *intent* instead of another symptom. The spin at
0x720af6–0x720b39 decodes to:

```
loop: ADDW2  $0x1154,%r8              ; next slot (0x1154 = sizeof slot)
      MULW3  $0x1154,*$0x72cf64,%r0   ; end = base + nslots*size
      ADDW2  $0x72cf68,%r0
      CMPW   %r0,%r8 ; BLUB skip ; MOVW $base,%r8   ; ring wrap
skip: ANDW3  $0x0401,0x50(%r8),%r0    ; poll slot flags
      CMPW   &1,%r0 ; BNEB loop       ; until a slot is runnable
```

A 16-slot ring scanned for `(flags & 0x401) == 1` — with `MAXPCHAN 16`, that is
**muxterm's idle scheduler loop looking for a runnable window process**. The "stall" was
an idle desktop.

Three ground truths converged (protocol sources read from `v8jerq.tap`, de-tapped and
untarred locally into `work/v8src/` — no boot needed):

- **The mpx packet protocol** (`jerq/src/mux/proto/`): header `0x80|cntl<<6|chan<<2|seq`,
  SEQMOD 4, CRC-16 trailing. The captured host tail `80 03 04 02 03 01 3a` is a valid
  seq-0 data packet; the terminal's `c0 02 06 03 de 61` is not a mystery message but —
  per `Reply()` in precv.c, which reuses the received header with the control bit set —
  **the ACK for it, piggybacked with control byte 03 = C_UNBLK**. The handshake had
  *succeeded*.
- **muxterm's COFF header** (`jerq/lib/muxterm` on the tape): tsize 47,820 + dsize 2,504
  = **50,324 loadable bytes; entry 0x71e85c** — the exact address in the GO packet
  captured on the wire (`ad 04 00 71 e8 5c`). The 144,603-byte *file* size that the
  bridge's completion test used includes an 80 KB symbol table that 32ld never sends.
- **Host-side `mux` idle in state I** with empty muxerr: normally waiting for terminal
  input, like every mux since 1985.

Every "suspicious" datum from Sessions 4–5 was normal operation: TX disabled at idle is
muxterm's interrupt-driven output discipline (enable/…/disable per burst, the `04,08`
command pairs); the `ad ad` double-ACK was a routine phase-1 retransmit; `isr=0x44` was
the known stale self-test artifact. Two sessions of theories shared one wrong premise —
"the transfer is incomplete" — planted by measuring against file size instead of text+data.

**Fixes that finished A0:**

- Bridge completion test: `burst > 50,324 && 8 s quiet` (was 70% of 144,603 — unreachable).
- Mouse: the 5620's registers (0x400000 y, 0x400002 x) are free-running counters; muxterm
  integrates sample deltas with **y counting up the screen**, cursor starting at (0,0).
  The bridge now maintains a modeled cursor and injects counter values per-move. (The
  observed cursor positions replayed through this model match pixel-for-pixel.)
- Gesture script per source: `menuhit()` centers the previously-hit item (initially
  item 0 = New) under the cursor, so press-release in place selects New; then sweep with
  button 3.

**Result (run 13):** button-3 menu renders (`New/Reshape/Move/Top/Bottom/Current/Memory/
Delete` — `menutext[]` verbatim), sweep creates a layer, host mux forks a shell into it,
and typed `date` + `cat /etc/motd` round-trip — the trolley-car motd rendered inside a
mux window on the emulated 5620. Screenshots: `work/shots-final/`. **A0's exit criterion
"mux usable end-to-end" is met.**

**Definitive timing** (the spike's last open measurement): the wire burst is **55,156
bytes** (50,324 payload + 32ld packet overhead + shell echo). At the DUART's ÷8 turbo
(9600-baud-equivalent) the download takes **~98 s**; at the fresh-NVRAM 1200-baud default
it computes to **~6 minutes** (156 B/s). The community's "15–17 minutes" lore is not
reproduced by pure line arithmetic on this muxterm — likely later/larger terminal
programs or host-side stalls; our numbers above are measured, not inherited.
