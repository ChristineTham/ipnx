Import Research Unix 8th Edition into v8/ as ipnx source.

    tools/v8-import.py            # write v8/ from the TUHS tapes
    tools/v8-import.py --report   # decide everything, write nothing
    tools/v8-import.py --verify   # prove v8/ still reproduces the tapes

This runs once to establish v8/ and thereafter only as `--verify`. After the
first commit the tree is *ours*: later divergence from Bell Labs is what git
log is for, so re-importing over local work would be a mistake, and the tool
refuses to unless --force is given.

Three transformations happen on the way in. Each is recorded in MANIFEST so
that "our copy is complete" stays a checkable claim rather than an assertion.

1. CASE COLLISIONS.  The tape names 16 groups of paths that differ only in
   case -- including two whole directories, usr/src/cmd/{Mail,mail} and
   jerq/src/lib/{C,c}.  macOS is case-insensitive, so a plain extraction
   silently merges those directories and drops 15 files; work/v8src has been
   quietly incomplete since the day it was made.  Git cannot check out both
   names either, so the loser of each group is stored with its uppercase
   letters percent-escaped (Mail -> %4Dail) and restored when the tree is
   staged into the guest, whose filesystem is case-sensitive and does not
   care.  Escaping a directory de-collides everything beneath it, which is
   why this is done per level, top down.

2. SOURCE ARCHIVES.  V7-era practice used ar(1) as a source container:
   usr/src/libplot/lib5620/blit.c.a holds 31 .c files, and the makefile does
   `ar x` before compiling.  An opaque blob defeats the purpose of version
   control, so any archive whose members are all text is unpacked -- the
   archive path becomes a directory holding its members.  The makefiles that
   used to unpack them are edited to match; that edit is ours and is a
   separate commit.

3. MACHINE CODE.  a.out executables, object libraries and binary data are not
   imported.  They are still listed in MANIFEST with size and sha256, so the
   exclusion is auditable and nothing is quietly missing -- if a build product
   turns out to have no source, the manifest is where that shows up.
