# Run the Tenth Edition golden image and hand you its console.
#
#	tools/v10-run.sh [image] [port]
#
# Starts a VAX-11/750 with the image attached, boots V10 multi-user, and puts
# the console on a telnet port so you can log in from your own terminal:
#
#	nc localhost 5610
#
# WHY TELNET AND NOT THE TERMINAL THIS RUNS IN.  A local-tty console makes ^E
# SIMH's stop character, so a stray one drops the machine to `sim>' with the
# guest still running.  On a telnet console ^E is an ordinary data byte --
# docs/a1-notes.md has the full table of which channel does what.
#
# WHY NOT THE ipnx APP.  The app is built around V8's machine: an RP07 on a
# Massbus, eight DZ lines, and a 5620 on line 0.  This is a 750 with an MSCP
# disk, and its kernel is seki, which has a `cometcons' console.  Making the
# app boot V10 is real work -- a second simulator in libsimh, a second media
# path, and the two-goldens design in docs/roadmap.md's B5 -- and none of it
# is needed to log in today.
#
# YOUR CLIENT MUST KEEP ITS STDIN OPEN.  SIMH treats a lost console as fatal
# -- `Console Telnet connection lost' and the simulator stops -- so a client
# that closes the socket takes the machine with it.  `nc localhost 5610' from
# a terminal is fine, because the terminal keeps stdin open.  `nc ... </dev/null'
# is not: nc exits on EOF, and the machine dies before the kernel banner.
# That cost several runs here, all of which looked like the guest crashing.
#
# HOW TO STOP IT.  Log in and `/etc/halt', then `pkill -f vax750'.  There is
# no clean-shutdown promise here: this image is reproducible in one command
# (tools/v10-golden.sh), which is why it is safe to be casual with.
