	tools/image-pack.py unpack [--in F] [--image F]
	tools/image-pack.py check  [--in F]

Defaults: work/myv8/rp07new  <->  image/ipnx-v8-rp07.img.xz

WHY AN IMAGE IS IN GIT AT ALL, given that CLAUDE.md says big binaries never
are.  The rule is right and this is its one exception, so it is worth being
precise about what makes it one.

A fresh Track S build needs a reference image to lift 1406 files off -- the
machine code Bell Labs shipped without source (v8/mk/gen/carry.txt).  Until
now that reference was the TUHS image, which is someone else's artefact,
not reproducible by us, and not in the repo.  Committing OUR image closes
that loop: the build's only external input becomes the tapes it was
imported from, and the tapes are already accounted for by v8/MANIFEST.

The exception is deliberately narrow: exactly one path, our own output,
and only because it is the input to the next build.  Everything else --
work/, rp06build, the .tap files -- stays out.

WHY xz AND NOT gzip.  Measured on the dense 40 MB of a V8 image: gzip -9
14.3%, bzip2 -9 11.5%, xz 8.8%.  On the whole 516 MB RP07 the difference
is larger still, because most of the volume is free blocks and xz's longer
window swallows them almost entirely: the built disk packs to 7.6 MB,
1.55% of raw.  Python's lzma is the same
compressor and is in the standard library, so this needs no xz(1) on the
host -- macOS does not ship one.

ZERO THE FILE BEFORE THE BUILD THAT MAKES THE ARTEFACT.  mkfs writes a
fresh i-list and free list but does NOT clear the data blocks, so a second
stage 8 over the same file leaves the previous run's contents in what the
new filesystem calls free space.  It is invisible to the guest and it is
not invisible to the compressor.  `pack' warns when the PACKED SIZE is out
of line -- a clean RP07 comes out at about 1.5% of raw, and stale data in
free space is high-entropy and stops compressing.

The nonzero figure it also prints is informational, not the test.  V8's
mkfs builds its free list downward from the top of the partition writing a
block every 150, so a brand-new empty filesystem has free-list blocks
threaded through the whole volume: a 492 MB image with 5% of its bytes set
is a normal, nearly-empty one.
