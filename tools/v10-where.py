Where does a Tenth Edition command belong?

    tools/v10-where.py            # regenerate v10/mk/where.txt
    tools/v10-where.py --check    # fail if it is stale

THE PROBLEM.  A build has to install what it makes, and "install" needs a
path.  For V8 that was a measurement: `tools/harvest-paths.sh` walked the
shipped TUHS image and wrote down where every binary actually was.  **V10 has
no shipped image** -- producing one is the whole of B3 -- so the same question
has to be answered from documents rather than from a disk.

THE ORACLE, IN ORDER OF AUTHORITY.

  mk     the tape's own makefile install rule -- `cp comp /lib/ccom',
         `mv as ${DESTDIR}/bin'.  The build stating what it does with its own
         product, which is precisely the rule we are reimplementing, so it
         outranks a description of the finished system.  Where the manual
         also has an answer the two are ASSERTED equal, not silently
         preferred: a disagreement would be a real finding about the tape.

  man    V10's own manual.  A section-8 SYNOPSIS opens with the full path --
         `/etc/init', `/etc/mkfs', `/etc/fsck' -- because that is how the
         Research manual documented programs you would not have on PATH.
         This is Bell Labs stating the answer, and it is primary.

  v8     v8/mk/where.txt, measured off a real Eighth Edition disk, for
         commands that exist in both editions.  V10 is V8's successor on the
         same machine and the same lineage, so a command in the same place in
         both is the overwhelmingly likely case -- but it is INFERENCE, not
         documentation, and the column says so.

  --     Neither.  Recorded as unresolved rather than guessed at, because a
         command installed to the wrong directory is invisible until
         something cannot find it, and by then the disk is built.  Track S
         learned this the expensive way: `yacc' and `strip' installed to
         bin/ instead of /usr/bin reached the toolchain and never the system,
         which no boot test could see.

WHY A SECTION-1 PAGE IS NOT ENOUGH.  It gives a bare name, which says the
command is on PATH and not which of /bin and /usr/bin holds it.  That is
exactly the distinction V8's measured file can supply and the manual cannot,
which is why both sources are here rather than one.

    THE STRONGEST EVIDENCE THERE IS, and it was going unread.  where.txt used to
    carry five hand-quoted install rules in MK and infer everything else, so a
    unit whose directory holds no <name>.c -- cmd/sh's main is main.c, cmd/make's
    is main.c, cmd/sed's is sed0.c -- got no row at all and world.link defaulted
    it to /usr/bin.  For `sh' that is not a cosmetic error: /etc/init execs
    `/bin/sh' (measured, in the golden's own binary), and /etc/rc -- which init
    runs THROUGH that shell -- is what mounts /usr.  A shell only in /usr/bin
    does not exist at the moment it is needed, which is V8 stage 8's disk that
    "walked 4,507 files and then stopped dead after autoconfig with the CPU

    to a scanner that only looked at destinations.  Reading `cp sh ...', whose
    source is the bare product, gets it right and rejects `cp $(FILES)
    /usr/src/cmd/make' at the same time.

    Two more traps, both of them CLAUDE.md's:  a recipe is a BLOCK and a line
    may hold several commands, so split on `;'; and continuation lines are
    joined FIRST, because sh's $OFILES showed what reading them separately does.
