"""Full scan: is everything that should be on the built disk actually on it?

	tools/config-audit.py [--ref IMG] [--ipnx IMG] [-v]

THE GAP THIS EXISTS TO CLOSE.  retire-check.py asks "is everything the TUHS
image had present?"  It is structurally incapable of noticing that something
of OURS is missing or unconfigured, because there is no reference for our own
additions -- and that is exactly how a golden disk shipped with

  * /etc/whoami reading `v8generic', so the machine did not know its name;
  * /etc/motd still the 1985 trolley-car joke rather than the licensing
    position this project actually runs under;
  * /etc/ttys with `03tty02'..`03tty05' -- leading 0 is DISABLED -- so six of
    the eight ttys the app opens had no getty at all;
  * no uname(1), which is ours and which the build had never been told about.

Every one of those passed retire-check with UNIQUE 0 and boot-newdisk with
thirteen green checks, because presence is not configuration and containment
is not completeness.

WHAT IT COMPARES, and why in two directions.

1. CONFIG, against a reference image that IS configured.  Binaries we build
   ourselves legitimately differ from the tape's (different compiler, 2026 vs
   1985), so those are skipped by looking at the a.out magic rather than by
   keeping a list.  Everything that is NOT an a.out -- shell scripts, /etc
   tables, termcap, the profiles -- should be byte-identical unless we changed
   it deliberately, and each deliberate difference is named in EXPECTED below
   with the reason.  Anything else is a config item that never made it into
   the build.

2. OURS, from the source tree.  Every file under v8/ that MANIFEST does not
   describe came from us rather than off the tape, so it has no business being
   absent.  Compared by inode TYPE as well as path, because a directory named
   /bin/sh satisfies a search for the file /bin/sh -- that is not
   hypothetical either, it is how 424 files became directories and the disk
   still passed its containment check.
