# K15 died on `"32ld.c":214:syntax error / saw EOF' over a 295-line file, and
# netfsd's trace showed one NREAD of 4096 bytes serving a 5870-byte file with no
# second read anywhere.  Byte 4096 of that file falls on line 213.  So the read
# really did stop after one block, and the failure presented as a defect in Bell
# Labs' source.
#
# THREE THINGS ARE MEASURED, and until now none of them was:
#   * truncation, by `wc -c' against the host's own stat -- no compiler involved.
#   * WHERE THE TIME GOES.  "~9.6 s per request" was K15's elapsed time divided by
#     399 requests, which is a request RATE: a guest compiling between requests
#     produces that number just as readily as a slow server does.  netfsd now
#     reports its own service time separately from time spent waiting on the
#     guest, so the two readings cannot be confused again.
#   * dropped frames, via `show il statistics' at the halt -- pdp11_il.c drops a
#     received frame outright when the guest has no buffer posted, and counts it.

# ===================== the file list, with HOST-SIDE truth ==================
# Sizes come from stat, never from a number written down here: a list that
# restates a measurement will disagree with it.  The set deliberately straddles
# the 4096 boundary in both directions, and includes the two files K15 and K14
# already measured -- 32ld.c, which failed, and a two-block file that worked.
# FOUR FILES, NOT SEVEN, AND THE FIRST RUN IS WHY.  Seven files x 3 passes x 2
# readers is 42 verdicts, and at ~7 s a netfs request that measured ~150 s a
# verdict -- so the run hit v10-netread.exp's own 3600 s deadline at 24 of 42, and
# the watchdog gave up the image mid-measurement.  A probe that cannot finish
# inside its own deadline is badly sized, not unlucky.
#
# So the list is trimmed to what the question needs: one file per interesting
# block count, plus the historical casualty.  1905 was redundant with 744, and
# 4900/6289 were redundant with 5870 as two-block cases.
