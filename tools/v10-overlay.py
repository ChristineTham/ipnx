Our corrections to Tenth Edition source, as a derived overlay.

    tools/v10-overlay.py --check    # fail if either is stale

WHY AN OVERLAY RATHER THAN AN IN-PLACE PATCH.  `v10/MANIFEST` is the record
that our copy of the TUHS tarballs is complete and unaltered -- 25,682 files,
every one hashed, re-checkable in about fifteen seconds.  Editing a file in
`work/v10/` would break that, and the ability to say "this is exactly what
Bell Labs shipped" is worth more than the convenience.  So the tree stays
pristine and our changed files live here, in git, served beside it.

WHY GENERATED RATHER THAN HAND-EDITED COPIES.  A checked-in copy of a
2,036-line file records the result and loses the change: a later reader
cannot see what we did without diffing against a tarball they may not have
unpacked.  Worse, it can drift -- someone edits the copy, and nothing says it
no longer corresponds to anything upstream.  Here each entry names the
pristine file, asserts its sha256, and applies a stated substitution.  A
changed base file fails loudly instead of being silently re-patched.

WHAT THE MAKEFILES DO WITH IT.  `v10/mk/mkdep.py` points a patched component
at `$(OURS)` instead of `$(SRC)`, so the provenance is visible in the
generated rule itself: a line reading $(SRC) is Bell Labs', a line reading
$(OURS) is ours.

V8's `/dev/pt/pt00`..`pt63` are **not** pseudo-ttys, which is why sixty-four
device names read for months as V8 hardware V10 lacks. V8's own `cdevsw` says
what they are:

	/*sp*/	nodev,	nodev,	nodev,	nodev,	/*18*/
		nodev,	nulldev,	&spinfo,

`spinfo` is the **stream pipe** (`v8/usr/sys/dev/spipe.c`), and V10 ships the
same driver as `lsys/io/spipe.c`, exporting
`struct cdevsw spcdev = cstrinit(&spinfo)`. mkconf's own catalogue already
knows how to configure it -- `lsys/lib/devs` line 64:

	pt	sp	count	data struct queue *spipes; inc sys/stream.h;

So the driver is present, the config catalogue is present, and the **table
entry is commented out with a question**: `# cdev 18 pt   # remove?`. Nobody
answered the question and nobody removed the driver.

Uncommenting it is a deviation of exactly the kind the authenticity rule
allows -- the tape cannot run as-is (every one of those nodes opens with
ENXIO), it is one named line, and the tape's *own other two files* are the
evidence that this is the state the tree was heading for rather than an
invention of ours. `ipnx780.m` gains `pt 64`, which is V8's own count.

        title="printf.c: an ANSI definition pcc2 cannot parse (B2.2c)",
        why="""\
One of eight `printf`/`scanf` members that compile under **neither** of the
tree's two compilers, which is the clearest single symptom of V10's unfinished
V9-to-V10 port.

	printf.c:5: syntax error; found `args' expecting `;'        (lcc)
	"printf.c":5:syntax error                                   (pcc2)

Two independent faults, and the tape's own siblings show it. `va_list` is
undeclared because `stdio/iolib.h` includes `<stdarg.h>` only `#ifdef sgi` --
its branches cover *V10 without stdarg*, *pANS with stdarg* and *SGI*, and not
*V10 with stdarg on a VAX*. And pcc2 cannot parse
`int printf(const char *fmt, ...)`.

**WHERE THE FIX BELONGS IS SETTLED BY THE TAPE, not by preference.** The two
members of this family that DO compile -- `vfprintf.c` and `vfscanf.c` -- carry
`#include <stdarg.h>` in the **.c file**, one line below `#include "iolib.h"`.
They are the only two in `libc/stdio` that do, and they are exactly the two
that build. So the convention in this tree is that the variadic source includes
the header itself, and these eight are simply missing that line: a per-file
omission, not a missing branch in a shared header. Restoring the line the
working siblings have is a smaller and better-evidenced change than rewriting
`iolib.h`'s `#ifdef` structure.

**THE DIRECTORY IN THE INCLUDE IS OURS, AND IT HAS TO BE.** `vfprintf.c` writes
a bare `<stdarg.h>`, which resolves only because `lcc` supplies its own include
path; **the r70 tree has no top-level `stdarg.h` at all** (only `lcc/`, `CC/`,
`olcc/`, `oCC/` and `cmd/gcc/`), so under `cc -I/usr/v10/include` a bare
`<stdarg.h>` finds nothing. `-I$(INCDIR)/lcc` is not the answer either: that
directory also holds `stdio.h`, `string.h` and `math.h`, and putting it on the
include path would silently shadow the system headers for every member. So the
subdirectory is named explicitly, in one line, shadowing nothing.

*This file shipped once with a bare `<stdarg.h>`* -- reasoning that named
`include/lcc/stdarg.h` over code that wrote a path finding nothing. It was
never tested, because the run that was supposed to test it read a source disk
that was being rewritten underneath it (see tools/norun.sh).

**The conversion direction is ANSI to K&R, and that is deliberate.** V10 keeps
the 1989 language; V11 is where the tree becomes ANSI (roadmap D-A4). It is
possible without touching the body because `include/lcc/stdarg.h` is itself
K&R-compatible -- `typedef char *va_list;` plus macros built from casts and
`sizeof` -- so `cc` can use the two-argument ANSI `va_start(args, fmt)` as it
stands. Its `((void)(...))` wrapper is safe: pcc2 accepts a cast to void, which
149 files in V8's own source tree rely on. The alternative, `varargs.h`, has a
ONE-argument `va_start(list)` and requires `va_alist`/`va_dcl`, so it would
have forced a rewritten parameter list and body.

So two changes: include the header the file's own working siblings include, and
give the definition an old-style parameter list. `...` is dropped because K&R
varargs is implicit -- the macros walk the stack from the last named parameter
either way -- and `const` because pcc2 has no such qualifier.""",

The only boot-path command that failed against BOTH header sets
(`tools/v10-bootpath.sh`):

	fsck.c: 22: Can't find include file stat.h

No bare `stat.h` exists in the r70 include tree or in either 1995 kernel tree
-- `sys/sys/stat.h` and `lsys/sys/stat.h` are both under `sys/` -- and every
other command in the tree writes `<sys/stat.h>`.

**This is not a typo, and the fix is not a guess: the line we want is sitting
there commented out.**

	#include <sys/inode.h>
	/* #include <sys/stat.h> */
	#include <stat.h>

fsck.c is a file caught mid-port. Three other includes are commented out the
same way -- `<ansi.h>`, `<posix.h>`, `<sys/dinode.h>` -- so someone was moving
it towards a different header environment and stopped, or moved it and never
moved it back. Whatever they were compiling against had a flat `stat.h`; the
Tenth Edition archive does not, and neither did the machine this is being
built for. Restoring their own commented-out line is the smallest correct
change and the one they had already written down.

(Related, for B2.2: `include/CC/sys/stat.h` and `include/oCC/sys/stat.h` are
alternative copies at 1089 and 961 bytes against the main tree's 959, so the
r70 reconstruction preserves more than one header environment. Worth knowing
before assuming a single answer to "which stat.h".)

        why="""\
`ROOTINO` is in `sys/param.h`, which mv.c does not include directly or
transitively.  It compiles against V8's headers only because **V8's**
`sys/types.h` includes `sys/param.h`.

That looked like r70 having dropped a line, and it is not: the tarball ships
its own 1995 copy of the header, and

	src/sys/sys/types.h  ==  include/sys/types.h     byte-identical

so the 1997 reconstruction is faithful and the source is the defect.  mv is
one of the ~237 command units with no prebuilt binary, which is consistent --
nobody had compiled it in place when the tape was cut.

**Adding `<sys/param.h>` is not enough, and the first attempt failed
instructively.**  V10's `sys/param.h` ends with `#include "sys/types.h"` and
V10's `sys/types.h` has **no include guard**, so a file that includes both
parses every typedef twice:

	"/usr/v10/include/sys/types.h":33:illegal type combination

So param.h REPLACES types.h rather than joining it.  `signal.h` goes the same
way for the same reason -- param.h already includes it, behind its own
`#ifndef NSIG`, and mv.c's copy would be the second.  Two lines out, one in,
and everything mv.c used still arrives.

`mkbitfs` makes the bitmapped 4096-byte filesystem `seki` boots from -- the
one `mkfs` cannot make, because `mkfs` is a Berkeley 4.2 file that writes only
the `S_free[]` list while BITFS keeps free space in `S_bfree[BITMAP]`.

It refuses to run unless its target has bit 6 set in the minor number. That is
right on a V10 machine, where `BITFS(dev) = ((dev) & 64)` is how a device
declares which variant it holds -- `seki`'s root is `ra 0100`, and 0100 octal
is 64.

**It cannot be satisfied on the Eighth Edition host.** V8's `hp` driver reads
the same bit as part of the drive number (`unit = minor(dev) >> 3`,
`sys/dev/hp.c:562`), so a minor with bit 6 set names drive 8 -- and SIMH's RP
has units 0 to 7. There is no node that both passes the check and reaches a
real disk.

The check asks about the machine doing the writing, when what decides the
format is the machine that will read it. The author's own `/* doubtful */`
sits on that line. So it becomes a warning: the diagnostic still prints, and
the caller stays responsible for pointing this at an image the *target* kernel
will see as BITFS.

\
V10 added 64-bit file offsets and `mkbitfs` uses them:

	off = Llmul(ltoL(size-1), BCOUNT);
	llseek(fd, off, 0);

V8's libc has none of that, so the link fails:

	Undefined:
	_ltoL
	_Llmul
	_llseek

**Linking V10's libc.a instead would be much worse than a build failure.**
`llseek` is system call slot **11**, and on a V8 kernel slot 11 is `exec` --
the one V7 vestige V10 reused. A V10 binary calling llseek on V8 does not
fail; it execs.

The filesystem this makes is 25,000 blocks of 4096 = 102 MB, and the largest
this tool can address in 32 bits is 2 GB, so the wide arithmetic buys nothing
here. `off` becomes a `long` and the seek an ordinary `lseek`.

`stdio.h`'s `BUFSIZ`, which is a different name for the same 4096. cc.c
includes `sys/types.h`, `stdio.h`, `ctype.h`, `signal.h` and `dir.h`, and
none of them reaches `param.h`.

`tcpconfig /dev/ip6 &` is what pushes the TCP line discipline onto an IP

	#include <stdio.h>
	#include <sgtty.h>
	#include <signal.h>
	...
	if(ioctl(fd, FIOPUSHLD, &tcp_ld) < 0){

r70's `<sgtty.h>` includes exactly one header, `<sys/ttyio.h>`, and neither
defines `FIOPUSHLD` -- so in K&R C the name becomes an implicit `extern int`
and the failure is a link error, `Undefined: _FIOPUSHLD`, naming a macro.
`TCPIOMAXSEG` on the two-argument path is unreachable the same way.

**This is not r70 skew and the usual control cannot settle it: there is no
`sgtty.h` in either 1995 kernel tree to `cmp` against.**  The tape answers it a
different way, in the same directory.  `ipconfig.c` -- the later generation of
the program beside this one -- names the headers outright:

	#include <sys/filio.h>
	#include <sys/inio.h>
	#include <sys/enio.h>

So the include list this file wants is written down; it simply belongs to its
successor.  That reading is corroborated by the state of the directory:
`tcpconfig` has **no rule in `ipc/internet/mkfile` at all**

        title="dipconfig.c: the same missing ioctl headers, three of them",
        why="""\
The same fault as `tcpconfig.c` above, in the program that gives the interface
its address.  `dipconfig` is used rather than `ipconfig` because the mkfile's
own two link lines differ:

	ipconfig:  cc -o ipconfig  ipconfig.o  $LIBIN $LIBCOMMON
	dipconfig: cc -o dipconfig dipconfig.o $LIBIN

`$LIBCOMMON` is `ipc/mgrs/common/libcommon.a` -- `logevent`, `logconsole`,
`detach`, `print`, `fprint` -- a twenty-seventh library, in no manifest, wanted
for a program whose extra features over this one are a subnet mask and a
syslog.  `dipconfig` performs the identical five ioctls (`FIOPUSHLD ip_ld`,
`IPIOLOCAL`, `IPIOHOST`/`IPIONET`, `IPIOARP`, `ENIOTYPE`) and needs only what
K10.2 already built.

It includes `<sgtty.h>` and `<sys/ethernet.h>`, which between them define none
of `FIOPUSHLD`, `IPIOLOCAL`, `IPIOHOST`, `IPIONET`, `IPIOARP`, `IPIORESOLVE`,
`ENIOTYPE` or `ENIOADDR`.  Every one of the eight is in the three headers
`ipconfig.c` names, and this file predates its successor naming them --
`ipconfig.c` is also the one with a subnet mask and `getopt`, so the two are
plainly successive drafts.  `ETHERPUP_IPTYPE` and `ETHERPUP_ARPTYPE` arrive
already, from the `<sys/ethernet.h>` this file does include.

**AND IT NAMES BOTH `<sys/param.h>` AND `<sys/types.h>`, WHICH IS THE `mv.c`
TRAP IN REVERSE.**  `sys/param.h` line 131 is `#include "sys/types.h"` and
`sys/types.h` has no include guard, so naming both parses all fourteen typedefs
twice.  Measured, and the error names the header rather than the file:

	"/usr/include/sys/types.h":33..47: illegal type combination
	"/usr/include/sys/types.h":39: syntax error / saw TYPE
	"/usr/include/sys/types.h":44: syntax error / saw [

Lines 33 to 47 are exactly `u_char` through `llong_t`; line 39 is
`typedef long daddr_t` where `daddr_t` is already a type name, and line 44's
`saw [` is `typedef long label_t[14]`.  So param.h REPLACES types.h rather than
joining it -- the same conclusion the `cmd/mv.c` entry reaches, arrived at from
the opposite direction (mv.c had to gain param.h; this has to lose types.h).
Nothing is lost: `fd_set`, which `doarp()` needs, is in types.h and still
arrives through param.h.  `<signal.h>` is safe as it stands, because it carries
its own `#ifndef NSIG` and this file includes it before param.h does.

**And the pattern predicted this.**  `dipconfig` has a rule in the mkfile and
**no prebuilt binary** -- exactly like `mv.c` and `fsck.c`, the two boot-path
commands whose one-line header faults this project already found.  What survived
on the tape is whatever was last compiled in place; what will not compile is
what nobody had compiled.""",

        title="streamio.c: istread() throws away the rest of the block",
        why="""\
netfs reads a reply in two calls -- the fixed-size `struct rcva` header, then
`y.count` bytes of data (`lsys/fs/neta.c:653,658`) -- and TCP hands the stream
head one block holding both.  `istread()` copies `min(count, ...)`, and then:

	n = bp->class;
	freeb(bp);              <- the data past `count' goes with it

So the header read consumes the header and DISCARDS the payload, and the second
call finds an empty queue and times out.  Measured on the running machine, with
the kernel printing its own diagnostic:

	# ls /n/host
	neta: read -1 expected 48

48 bytes is three 16-byte V8 directory entries -- `.`, `..` and `hello.txt` --
which `netfsd` logged itself as having sent.  So the bytes reached the guest and
the kernel threw them away; nothing about the transport was wrong.

**This is the N track's own finding, and V8's fix is the model.** That project's
`usr/sys/sys/streamio.c` makes three changes for exactly this reason
(`tools/drive-streamfix.sh`, phase N6), and two of the three transfer to V10:

	a zero-length read returns 0          transfers -- V10 would sleep 30 SECONDS
	                                      and then return -1
	a partly consumed block is put back   transfers -- this is the fault above
	an empty queue waits for more         TRANSFERS AFTER ALL, and the first
	                                      reading of this table was wrong -- see
	                                      below.

Safe for the same reason it was safe on V8: `lsys/fs/neta.c` and `netb.c` are
the only callers of `istread` in the whole kernel, and both want byte-stream
semantics.  `usr/src/netfs/README` asked for this in as many words -- "The code
here assumes it is talking to Datakit in several places.  If you want to use
another network, you'll have to fix things."

**ALL THREE OF V8'S CHANGES TRANSFER, AND THE THIRD ONE TOOK TWO MEASUREMENTS TO
ADMIT.** The table above first read "does not transfer: V10 already guards it with
QDELIM" -- true of the guard and false of the machine. `istread()` returns short on

	if ((nc && (OTHERQ(stq->wrq->next)->flag&QDELIM)==0) || stq->flag&HUNGUP)

so the guard fires only when the downstream read queue advertises QDELIM -- and the
tcp device correctly never does (see below), so the branch is always live. K12's
24/24 did not catch it because every read there was small enough to arrive in one
block: 48 bytes of directory, 52 bytes of file. The first read big enough to span
TCP segments said so at once, on K14's build off a live share:

	neta: read 2000 expected 2898

Same shape as the NI1010 chaining bug, one layer up: *it survived N2, N3 and most
of N6 because nothing before netfs ever sent a frame over 1024 bytes.* So the
branch goes, exactly as V8's does, and `istread` now waits for the full count
unless the far end has hung up. Safe for V8's reason: `lsys/fs/neta.c` and
`netb.c` are the only callers in the kernel and both want byte-stream semantics.

**AND THE QDELIM HALF OF THIS IS RETRACTED, having been measured and found
wrong.** A previous version of this overlay also set `QDELIM` on
`lsys/inet/tcp_device.c`'s queues, on the argument that `tcp_ld.c` sets it on both
of its own and that `ni1010a.c`, `deqna.c`, `kdi.c` and `debna.c` all write
`QDELIM|QBIGB` together -- so its absence read as an omission by the tape's own
pattern. It is not an omission, it is a decision, and the counter-evidence was
sitting in the same file: `stread()` carries the identical short-return guard and
then sleeps with `tsleep(…, STIPRI, 0)` -- **timeout zero, i.e. for ever**. So on a
queue advertising QDELIM, any read not exactly satisfied blocks permanently, and a
TCP byte stream never sends a delimiter to end the wait. Measured: `nafsmnt`
connected, completed the NSTART handshake -- netfsd logged `mounted … as dev 0` --
and then hung in `read()` of the reply until the harness's watchdog stopped the
machine. Every driver that does set QDELIM is **message-oriented** (Ethernet
frames, Datakit), and `tcp_ld.c` sets it on the *discipline*, which frames its own
messages; the tcp **device** hands userland a byte stream and says so by leaving
the flag clear. Reading a pattern across four drivers is not evidence about a
fifth whose job is different.

The delimiter check moves inside the fully-consumed branch, because `bp->class`
belongs to the block and a block that has been put back has not delivered its
delimiter yet.  V10 carries the delimiter as `S_DELIM` in `bp->class` where V8
used a separate `M_DELIM` message type, so the shape differs from V8's patch
even though the correction is the same.""",

# WHY THE LAST NAMED PARAMETER MATTERS.  va_start(args, fmt) takes the address

Seven lines, one prototype, and it went missing for a whole round. `atof.o` was
never in our `libc.a`, and the first thing to report it was **stage 3** -- `ccom`
and `as` both failed to link with

	Undefined:
	_atof

which is what an absent libc member looks like two stages downstream. Stage 2
had said so at the time; the host-side counter dropped the line, because the tty
echo spliced an `M` onto the front of `MISS atof.o` and the grep was anchored at
`^`. The same one compile error also accounts for stage 2's `install` failure
(`make install` retries the missing object) and for its member list not matching
the tape's.

`const char *s` is the only thing pcc2 cannot parse here, so the parameter list
is all that moves. **The `#include <stdlib.h>` stays, and that is the whole
subtlety**: K&R C defaults an undeclared function to `int`, so dropping the
include would truncate `strtod`'s `double` to a word and give a silently wrong
`atof` -- much worse than a compile error. r70's `include/libc.h` line 15 is

	extern double atof(), strtod();

which is exactly the K&R declaration this needs, and `/usr/include/stdlib.h`

One of the eleven members that only `lcc` could build, and `lcc` cannot be
trusted to: the prebuilt driver hits the `bowell.c` defect
(`0: unknown flag -undef`) and emits **empty objects while exiting 0**, so
routing a member to it buys a silent hole in `libc.a` rather than a member.

These carry `/* Copyright AT&T Bell Laboratories, 1993 */` and are addressed to
a header set that is not installed: r70's `/usr/include` has no `stddef.h`, no
`stdlib.h`, and defines `size_t` nowhere. That is the same two-generations split
as the stdio family, one layer down -- not a prototype to strip but a different
C to translate out of.

`void *` becomes `char *` and `size_t` becomes `unsigned int`. Both pairs are
the same width on a VAX, `char *` is K&R's generic pointer, and it is how V8's
own libc declares these functions -- so the generated code is unchanged and only
the spelling moves back eight years."""

 *	pex, unpex	here, as failing stubs.
 *
 * NONE OF THE THREE BELOW CAN RUN ON V10, and that is the finding rather than a
 * limitation -- see the SIGLAB note under unsafe().  They exist so the program
 * links; the paths that reach them are dead on a kernel with no labels.
 */

/*
 * IX's unsafe(2) is a LABELLED select(2): the kernel filters the ready set by
 * the caller's label.  On a machine with no process labels that filtering is the
 * whole difference, so a plain select is the right semantics and not an
 * approximation of it.
 *
 * COMPILING IX's OWN unsafe.c WOULD NOT DO.  It is seven lines --
 *
 *	unsafe(n, r, w) fd_set *r, *w; { return syscall(64+36, n, r, w); }
 *
 * -- and V10's lsys/os/sysent.c:184 is `0, nosys,' with the tape's own comment
 * `64+36 = nosys'.  An empty slot: it would fail rather than do something else's
 * work, but it WOULD fail, and mux's next line is quit("unsafe failed").
 *
 * V10's select takes FOUR arguments -- libc/sys/select.s says `.set select,38'
 * over the comment `select(nfd, rfdset, wfdset, time)', and sysent.c:122 is
 * `4, select'.  mux already calls it that way at mux.c:265, so the four-argument
 * form is the program's own idiom rather than an assumption about V10.
 *
 * THE TIMEOUT IS 0 BECAUSE THIS IS A POLL, and getting that backwards would
 * have busy-spun the program.  lsys/os/sys2.c:242 reads the fourth argument as
 * MILLISECONDS and short-circuits on zero:
 *
 *	rem = (ap->timo+999)/1000 - (time - t);
 *	if (ap->timo == 0 || rem <= 0)

 * so 0 means "report what is ready now", NOT "block".  That is exactly what the
 * one call site wants: mux.c:1051 is inside checklabs(), which passes all-ones
 * fd sets to ask which descriptors are readable at this instant and loops
 * `while(nseen)' only while it keeps finding some.  A blocking select there
 * would hang; a zero-timeout one answers.
 *
 * AND ON V10 IT IS NEVER CALLED.  checklabs() runs only when `siglab' is set,
 * and siglab is set only by the SIGLAB handler installed at mux.c:212.  r70's
 * own signal.h:37 defines it -- `SIGLAB 26 / * file label changed; secure unix
 * only (not reset) * /' -- and the annotation is accurate: SIGLAB appears
 * NOWHERE in lsys/, so the V10 kernel never raises it.  NSIG is 32, so the
 * signal(2) call is accepted and simply never fires.  This function therefore
 * has to link and does not have to work -- which is the honest reason it is

	unsafe            here, mapped onto select(2)
	pex, unpex        here, as failing stubs

`labEQ.c` and `labLE.c` are pure K&R against `<sys/label.h>`, which
`v10/mk/gen/mux.inc` installs, so they need no patch and are named in `mux.mk`'s
OBJS rather than here.

### `unsafe` is a poll, and reading it as a wait would have busy-spun the program

IX's `unsafe(2)` is a **labelled** `select(2)`: the kernel filters the ready set
by the caller's label, so on a machine with no process labels a plain select is
the right semantics rather than an approximation of it. IX's own `unsafe.c`
cannot simply be compiled -- it is `syscall(64+36, n, r, w)` and V10's
`lsys/os/sysent.c:184` is `0, nosys,` under the tape's own comment
`64+36 = nosys`. An empty slot fails rather than doing something else's work, but
it *does* fail, and mux's next line is `quit("unsafe failed")`.

V10's select takes **four** arguments (`libc/sys/select.s`: `.set select,38`
over `select(nfd, rfdset, wfdset, time)`; `sysent.c:122`: `4, select`), and
mux already calls it that way at `mux.c:265` -- so the four-argument form is the
program's own idiom, not an assumption about V10.

**The fourth argument is MILLISECONDS and zero means POLL**, which is the detail
that decides whether this code is right. `lsys/os/sys2.c:242`:

	rem = (ap->timo+999)/1000 - (time - t);
	if (ap->timo == 0 || rem <= 0)
		goto done;

so 0 short-circuits past the `tsleep` and reports what is ready now. That is
exactly what the one call site wants: `mux.c:1051` sits inside `checklabs()`,
which passes **all-ones** fd sets to ask which descriptors are readable at this
instant and loops `while(nseen)` only while it keeps finding some. A blocking
select there would hang.

### And on V10 none of the three is ever CALLED

`checklabs()` runs only when `siglab` is set, and `siglab` is set only by the
`SIGLAB` handler installed at `mux.c:212`. r70's own `signal.h:37` defines it --
`SIGLAB 26 / * file label changed; secure unix only (not reset) * /` -- and the
annotation is accurate: **`SIGLAB` appears nowhere in `lsys/`**, so the V10
kernel never raises it. `NSIG` is 32, so the `signal(2)` call is accepted and
simply never fires.

So these three functions have to **link** and do not have to **work**, which is
the honest reason `unsafe` is three lines and `pex` is a stub rather than a
labelled select we cannot implement.

### `pex` fails, and failing is behaviour mux is written for

IX's `src/libc/pex.c` is not a syscall at all -- it drives an ioctl protocol on
`FIOPX`, and V10's `sys/filio.h` has no `FIOPX`, so there is nothing to map it
onto. `mux.c:186`:

	if(pex(0,-1,0)!=0) { untrusted++; unpex(0,-1); }

A non-zero return marks the session untrusted, and a mux on a kernel with no
process exclusion **is** untrusted. The stub does not defeat that check; it gives
the true answer to it.
""",
        evidence="""\
Every claim above is a file and a line in the tarball, so none of it rests on
inference:

	the empty syscall slot   lsys/os/sysent.c:184   `0, nosys,'  / * 64+36 * /
	select is 38, 4 args     libc/sys/select.s      `.set select,38'
	                         lsys/os/sysent.c:122   `4, select,'
	timo is ms, 0 = poll     lsys/os/sys2.c:242     `(ap->timo+999)/1000'
	the only unsafe() call   mux.c:1051             inside checklabs()
	mux's own 4-arg select   mux.c:265              select(NSELFD,&rdfd,0,SELTIMO)
	pex's answer is used     mux.c:186              `untrusted++'
	SIGLAB exists in r70     include/signal.h:37    `26 / * secure unix only * /'
	and is never RAISED      grep -rn SIGLAB lsys/  -- no match at all
	signal 26 is in range    include/signal.h:2     `NSIG 32'

The two that decide correctness rather than merely justifying it are the third
and the last two. **`timo == 0` means poll**, so a draft of this file that
described 0 as "the blocking timeout" was wrong in both directions and would
have busy-spun mux had `checklabs()` been reachable -- and it is **not**
reachable, because nothing in the V10 kernel ever sends the signal that arms it.

**WHAT "SHARES" MEANS HERE, because the name misleads.** Not network shares and
nothing to do with files: this is the **fair-share CPU scheduler**. `share(5)`
calls it *"Share Scheduling on Unix"* and describes a *"per-user long term
scheduler"* that weighs *"the history of a user's usage of the resources of the
machine"*; `l_shares` is *"allocated shares"*, `l_usage` *"decaying accumulated
costs"*. `/etc/shares` is indexed by uid and holds *"the uid, scheduling group
and allocated shares for each user"*, and `setupshares(3)` reads a user's
allocation at login, decays their usage to the current time, and installs it in
the kernel through `limits(2)`. Users form a tree of scheduling groups, each
taking a proportion of its parent's CPU. `limits(2)`'s own `.TH` line reads
`SHARE-deprecated`, so Bell Labs were retiring it by 1995 -- which is of a piece
with its headers being the ones the 1997 reconstruction lost.

Six libc members include `<shares.h>`, which includes `<sys/lnode.h>`, and
**neither file is anywhere in the 25,682**. Their objects are in the tape's
`libc.a`, so both existed; what survived is a source tree with two headers
missing from it.

This was written down as an unreachable ceiling -- "six members cannot be built
by anything, so the ceiling from source is 255" -- and that was wrong, because
it treated the *source tree* as the only evidence. **The tape also carries its
own manual, and `lnode(5)` reproduces this header field by field**, under the
words:

	The layout as given in the include file is:

followed by `struct lnode`, the five `l_flags` bits, `typedef short uid_t`, and
`struct kern_lnode` complete with comments. `limits(2)` supplies the twelve
`L_*` function numbers in a table. So the header is not being invented from its
consumers -- it is being read out of the documentation, which is exactly the
rule this project already applies to member order: where the tape's own
artefacts can settle a question, they do.

**And the manual is then checked against the machine code**, because a manual
can drift from a header and a compiled object cannot. Every field's offset and
width is confirmed in Bell Labs' 1989 objects; the evidence is below.

`<sys/share.h>` and `<sys/retlim.h>` are missing too and are **not**
reconstructed: nothing on the tape states their layout. That costs exactly one
member -- see `setupshares` in the notes below.""",

two sizes agree at five independent sites, and `L_SETLIM` agrees with
`limits(2)`'s table. The reconstruction is measured, not inferred.

**WHAT IS NOT RECONSTRUCTED, and why the sixth member stays unbuilt.**
`setupshares.c` also includes `<sys/share.h>` for a `struct sh_consts`, and
that struct is documented nowhere: `share(5)` describes the *algorithm* and
never prints the header, `limits(2)` mentions the name and no field, and
**`sh_consts` appears nowhere in `lsys/` or `sys/`** -- so even the kernel we
have does not reference it. `setupshares.o`'s prologue is `subl2 $144, sp`,
which bounds it but does not give a layout, and `setupshares()` uses no field of
it -- only `limits((struct lnode *)&shconsts, L_GETCOSTS)`, a call that has the
KERNEL write through that pointer. An opaque array of a guessed size would
compile, link, and overwrite the caller's stack if the size were wrong by a
single word. So it is left out, and the count is **260 of 261**, not 261.""",

        why="""\
The header the six `libc/gen` share routines include. `shares(5)` names it --
"other scheduling data as defined in the files `<shares.h>` and
`<sys/lnode.h>`" -- and gives its installed path as `/usr/include/shares.h`,
which is where our build puts it; no makefile change is needed because
`$(INCS)` already names that directory.

Its contents are fixed by what the six sources use and by what the compiled
1989 objects prove:

  * `Share` -- `putshares.c` writes `share.l = *lp; share.extime = extime;` and
    seeks `sizeof(Share) * uid`, so it is a struct of an `lnode` and an
    `unsigned long`. The object gives 20 bytes with `extime` at offset 16,
    which is that layout exactly and no padding.
  * `MAXUID` -- compiled as an immediate `$10000` in both `putshares.o` and
    `getshares.o`.
  * `SHAREFILE` -- `openshares.c` initialises `ShareFile = SHAREFILE` and the
    object's only string is `/etc/shares`.
  * `SYSERROR` -- `(-1)`, the tree's own spelling (`cmd/hdr/defs.h`), guarded
    by `#ifndef` because `setupshares.c` defines it again itself.
  * the function declarations -- return types straight out of `getshares(3)`,
    `getshput(3)`, `openshares(3)`, `putshares(3)`, `sharesfile(3)` and
    `setlimits(3)`; all K&R, so no prototype and no parameter list, which is
    both what pcc2 accepts and what a 1989 header would have said.

The six sources are already pure K&R and need no conversion -- their failure
was never a language problem, which is why five of them come back the moment
the header exists.""",
        evidence="""\
See `sys/lnode.h` above: the same four objects prove `sizeof(Share) = 20`,
`extime` at offset 16, and `MAXUID = 10000`, and `openshares.o` carries
`/etc/shares` as its only string constant.

The one thing here that is a *convention* rather than a measurement is
`SYSERROR (-1)`: it is not visible in an object (`d0 8f ff ff ff ff 50` is
`movl $-1, r0`, which proves the value but not the spelling), and the tree
defines it identically in three other places -- `cmd/hdr/defs.h`,
`cmd/cyntax/cyn/defs.h`, `cmd/cyntax/cem/cem.h` -- plus a fourth time inside
`setupshares.c`. The `#ifndef` guard is there because of that fourth one.""",
