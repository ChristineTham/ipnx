"""How much room is left in a Tenth Edition filesystem, read from the host.

    tools/v10-free.py <image> [partition]     default partition c
    tools/v10-free.py <image> c --need 20000  exit 1 unless that many free

WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY NO GUEST-SIDE PROBE CAN REPLACE IT.  A full V10
filesystem does not fail -- it HANGS.  lsys/fs/alloc.c prints `file system
full' and sleeps, waiting for space that is never coming, so the process
blocks in the kernel instead of returning an error.  That defeats every
guest-side guard by construction: the compile never fails, so a
count-consecutive-failures detector never counts, and a `dd'/`cat' probe would
block in exactly the same place as the thing it is meant to protect.  Twice
now a run has been launched at an image whose /usr was already nearly full --
once at `.stage1.s2.s3', which carries four toolchain installs and two object
trees, and once at `.stage1' -- and both times the symptom was a simulator at
100% CPU with a kernel message repeating every few seconds.

So the check has to happen before the boot, on the host, against the image
file.  That is the same argument tools/v8fs.py was written from: "read a disk
from the host -- don't boot one to look".

SELF-VALIDATING, BECAUSE A STRUCT OFFSET COMPUTED FROM A HEADER IS A GUESS
UNTIL SOMETHING CONFIRMS IT.  The field offsets below are computed from
lsys/sys/filsys.h and VAX alignment, and then checked against two things the
superblock itself must satisfy: s_fsize has to match the partition's declared
size, and s_fsmnt has to hold a plausible mount name.  If either fails the tool
refuses to answer rather than reporting a number derived from the wrong bytes.
