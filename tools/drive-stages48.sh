# Stages 4 to 8 against a build filesystem that already has stages 1 to 3.
#
#	tools/drive-stages48.sh [limit] [port] [first-stage] [last-stage] [ref-image] [rp06|rp07]
#
# first-stage defaults to 4.  Stages 4 to 7 leave their products on the build
# filesystem, so when only stage 8 has changed, `tools/drive-stages48.sh "" ""
# 8 8' reaches it in a couple of minutes instead of fifty.  Nothing is skipped
# silently: the summary below reports the skipped stages as such.
#
# last-stage defaults to 9.  Stage 9 is the chroot self-rebuild and costs the
# better part of an hour; iterating on what stage 8 puts ON the disk does not
# need the new system re-proved able to rebuild itself every time.
#
# tools/drive-stage1.sh spends about fifty minutes rebuilding the toolchain
# before it reaches anything you are iterating on.  rp06build is a FILE and it
# survives the run that made it, so stages 4 onward can be re-run against it
# directly -- about fifteen minutes instead of eighty.
#
# Use drive-stage1.sh when the toolchain, libc or the fixpoint has changed.
# Use this when only stages 4 to 8 have.  It deliberately does NOT recreate or
# mkfs rp06build: if /b/tools3 is not there, the stage scripts say so and stop.
