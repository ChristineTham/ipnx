# Stage 2 of the Tenth Edition bootstrap: libc, built on V10.
#
#	tools/v10-stage2.sh [stage1-image] [src-image]
#
# The stage order is V8's, from docs/build-from-source.md:
#
#	1  the toolchain
#	2  libc                          <-- this
#	3  the toolchain again, with stage 2's libc -- the fixpoint
#	4  headers   5  libraries   6  commands   7  kernel   8  disk
#	9  the new system rebuilds itself under chroot
#
# IT STARTS FROM THE STAGE-1 MACHINE, NOT THE GOLDEN.  Stage 1 left its
# compiler under /usr/s1 and installed ar, cmp, ed and tail into the running
# system; this stage needs all of them, and it asserts each one before it
# builds anything so that a run started from the wrong image says so in one
# line rather than in 261 confusing ones.
#
# THE CLONE RULE APPLIES, and harder than on V8: there is no committed V10
# image to restore from, and recovery is a half-hour tools/v10-golden.sh
# followed by a stage-1 run.  See tools/v10clone.sh.
#
# THE SOURCE DISK IS CLONED TOO, and it did not used to be.  The comment here
# used to read "the source disk is NOT cloned -- it is mounted read-write but
# only read", which was true of THIS run and irrelevant, because the hazard was
# never this run writing it.  tools/v10-srcdisk.sh REBUILDS that path with
# `dd if=/dev/zero of=$GOLD/ipnx-v10-src.img', and on 2026-08-17 it did so
# while a stage-2 run had the file attached as rq1.  Both exited 0 and every
# number the stage-2 run produced was measured against an image that changed
# mid-run.  See tools/norun.sh.
#
# `cp -c' is free on APFS, so "we only read it" was never worth the exposure.
