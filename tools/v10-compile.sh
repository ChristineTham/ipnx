#
# THE MEASUREMENT IS THE DISAGREEMENT.  tools/v10-world.py predicts, host-side
# and free, which units can resolve every header they include; this run measures
# which ones V10's own compiler accepts.  Printing both and diffing them is the
# whole point: agreement means the survey can be trusted for the rest of K10,
# and each disagreement is a specific fact neither instrument could produce
# alone.

# GOLD is a bare name under work/v10gold and SRC is a FULL PATH, which looks

# to what it is given, so it needs the path.  Matching them exactly rather than
# tidying it, because a harness that differs from the proven ones in a small way
# is a harness whose failures are ambiguous.
# STAGE 1'S IMAGE, NOT THE MOST COMPLETE ONE, AND THE FIRST RUN FAILED ON EXACTLY
# THAT MISTAKE.  `.stage1.s2.s3' was chosen for having the whole toolchain -- and
# it carries /usr/s1, /usr/s2, /usr/s3, /usr/s3b AND stage 2's and stage 3's
# object trees, all on a 128 MB partition that was nearly full before this run's
# scratch directory existed.  22 units in, the kernel began printing
# `/mnt2: file system full' once every few seconds and the run ground on
# uselessly.
#
# Compiling needs the PASSES and nothing else -- no libc, because -c never
# links -- so stage 1's image is both sufficient and roomy.  "Most complete" was
# the wrong axis; the right one was "has room".
