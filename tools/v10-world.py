"""K10: survey the Tenth Edition's WORLD before trying to build it.

    tools/v10-world.py                  the summary
    tools/v10-world.py --units          every unit, one per line
    tools/v10-world.py --headers        which headers are missing, and to whom
    tools/v10-world.py --unit NAME      everything known about one unit
    tools/v10-world.py --write          write v10/mk/gen/world.txt
    tools/v10-world.py --check          ... or fail if it is out of date

WHY A HOST-SIDE SURVEY COMES FIRST.  B1 and B2.0 were both won by putting the
decisive measurement ahead of the machinery, and the same argument applies with
more force here: K10 is ~283 commands, so a guest run that compiles the world
costs hours, while the question "which of these can even find their headers"
is a one-second question on the host.  tools/v10-syscalls.py is the model --
it answered "which syscalls does a V10 program get wrong on a V8 kernel" from
two tables and saved a boot per answer.

WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT TELL YOU.  It resolves #include directives against
the header set we actually install, so a unit reported MISSING will certainly
fail, and for a stated reason.  A unit reported OK has only cleared that one
hurdle -- it may still fail to parse.  That asymmetry is deliberate: this tool
exists to shrink the guest run, not to predict its result.

THE ANSI COLUMN IS A HEURISTIC AND IS LABELLED AS ONE.  CLAUDE.md's rule --
"a failure under compiler X is not evidence that compiler Y would succeed" --
has a corollary: a REGEX is not evidence that either compiler fails.  jterm.o
spent two runs listed as an lcc member on exactly this kind of inference.  So
the ANSI count is printed as a hint about where the conversion work will land
and is never used to exclude a unit from the build.

THE INCLUDE SCAN USES THE LOOSE REGEX, WHICH IS NOT OPTIONAL.  V10's cpp.c
opens with `# include <libc.h>' -- a space after the hash, ordinary 1970s
style and common in this tree.  A scan matching a bare "#include" misses those
and then reports every header present, which cost a whole boot once.

# THE ANCHORING BUG THIS TOOL SHIPPED WITH, and why re.M is no longer what
# protects against it.  The first version scanned each file with finditer() and
# no re.M, so `^' anchored to offset 0 of the whole file and an include was
# found only in a file whose very FIRST character began one.  Every other file
# reported zero includes, hence zero missing headers, hence "clean" -- it
# announced 348 of 351 commands able to resolve every header when the figure
# was 327 and most files had not been read at all.  Same failure family as the
# ^-anchored grep that dropped `MMISS atof.o' and the spliced tty that inflated
# the byte-identical count: the error ran in the FLATTERING direction, which is
# why it read as a result instead of a bug.
#
# includes_of() now walks line by line, and .match() anchors at the start of
# the string it is given, so the flag is inert here -- kept only so the pattern
# reads correctly if it is ever used against whole text again.  What actually

#
# K10.1b EXTENDS THE SAME DECISION PAST libc's THREE, and the extension is
# smaller than the candidate list because most of the candidates are not C.
# Measured, one variant at a time, with installable() below rather than by eye:
#
#   stddef.h  7 units   lcc/  CC/  olcc/     all three parse; lcc's is chosen
#                       because it GUARDS its size_t typedef (_SIZE_T/_SIZE_T_)
#                       and the other two typedef unconditionally -- so lcc's
#                       is the only one that can be installed beside another
#                       header doing the same without a redeclaration error.
#   limits.h  3 units   lcc/  CC/           both parse; lcc's is chosen on
#                       correctness -- CC's says `INT_MIN 0x80000000', which is
#                       an UNSIGNED constant in C, where lcc's says
#                       `(-INT_MAX-1)'.
#   u.h       1 unit    olcc/  libc/        olcc's parses; libc's declares an
#                       ANONYMOUS STRUCT inside a union, which pcc2 has no
#                       syntax for.  cmd/lp uses the typedefs and not `Length',
#                       so olcc's macro form of it costs nothing.
#

# rather than a shortfall -- r70's only copy of each is written in a language

    cmd/uucp 11.  world.link names all of them and builds none, because linking
    a unit's objects together fails on `multiply defined _main' and the obvious
    repair is worse than the skip -- pairing each main with ALL the unit's other
    objects would give cmd/awk a `maketab' carrying the whole of awk, since ld
    pulls in every .o it is named.

    WHICH OBJECTS BELONG TO WHICH PROGRAM IS IN THE UNIT'S OWN MAKEFILE, and

      explicit   a recipe line linking by name --  `cc -o pack pack.o',
                 `cc -o decrypt decrypt.o $(OBJS)'.  Macros are expanded, so
                 descrypt's shared $(OBJS) reaches both of its programs.

      implicit   a target line naming exactly one source and no recipe --
                 cmd/PDP11's `11cc:   11cc.c', which lets make's built-in rule
                 do the link.  That is the cmd/docgen shape CLAUDE.md already
                 records: `docgen: docgen.c' produces no docgen.o anywhere, so
                 a test that demanded an object would drop the program the unit
                 is named after.

    Anything with neither witness is left out rather than guessed at, exactly as
    out_of_build() refuses rather than dropping half a unit's sources.

    OBJECTS ARE BASENAMES because that is where they land: cc.c's setsuf()
    returns the basename, so `cc -c vax/hello.c' writes ./hello.o -- the same
    property that makes the whole out-of-tree build work.

    """One row per PROGRAM inside a multi-main unit, from the tape's own rules.

    THE PHASE world_link() DEFERRED.  Its comment says so outright -- "which
    objects belong to which program is in each unit's own makefile, and writing
    those out is mkdep.py-scale work ... so they are named, with the count, and
    left for the phase that generates a makefile per program."  This is that
    phase, and it does not generate makefiles: it reads the ones the tape has.

    K16's audit is why it could not wait any longer.  Of the 170 command names
    the V8 golden has and V10's did not, about forty are programs inside these
    units -- the eight-piece PDP-11 cross-toolchain in cmd/PDP11, `awk', `troff',
    `ex', `dc', `cb', `at', `csh', `unpack', `encrypt'/`decrypt', the asd
    package tools, `rogue' and `mille'.  Every one of them has source here and a
    link rule that names it.

    FIVE FIELDS AND A TAIL: program, unit, directory, destination, -l flags,
    then the objects.  The flags are comma-joined into ONE token so the tail
    stays one kind of thing -- v8's destdirs.txt held two kinds told apart by a
    leading tab and the 1985 shell split on IFS before the marker was seen, and
    458 files became empty directories.  A `-' means none.

    A unit with several main()s and NO recognisable link rule is recorded as
    such rather than guessed at, exactly as out_of_build() refuses rather than
    dropping half a unit's sources: pairing each main with all the unit's
    objects would give cmd/awk a `maketab' carrying the whole of awk.

# The survey's guest half.  Generated rather than hand-written because it has
# to live in v10/mk/gen/ to reach the source disk, and everything in there is
# generated and --check'd; a hand-edited file among them is one mkdep.py could
# overwrite without anyone noticing.
#
# FIVE THINGS IN HERE ARE SCAR TISSUE, each from a documented failure:
#   * no grep, no wc, no tail -- the V10 golden has none of them (measured
#     against prebuilt.txt).  sed does the filtering.
#   * markers spelled through shell variables, so the tty's echo of the command
#     carries `$P' and only the RESULT carries the token.  An echoed literal
#     defeats matching either way round.
#   * objects are written to $OBJ, never beside the source: the source disk is
#     a courier and a build that writes to it changes its srcid, so the next
#     stage would refuse it.
#   * every .o is removed per unit, so 353 units cost no more space than one.
#   * A CANARY RUNS FIRST.  If the compiler flags are wrong, all 353 units fail
#     and that reads like a finding about V10 rather than a mistake in the
#     harness -- so one file known to build is compiled before the loop, and a
#     failure there prints NOCANARY and stops.  Same argument as sanity() on
#     the host side: a measurement taken through a broken instrument must
#     refuse to print a number.

# A SECOND CANARY, FOR ROOM, because the first run of this survey died of a
# full filesystem 22 units in and kept going for hours -- the kernel printing
# `/mnt2: file system full' every few seconds while every remaining unit failed
# for a reason that had nothing to do with the Tenth Edition.  A wrong image is
# as fatal as wrong flags and was not being checked.
#
# AND THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS PROBE USED `dd', WHICH THIS MACHINE DOES NOT
# HAVE.  `dd: not found' -- the golden is missing it exactly as it is missing
# ar, cmp, tail, grep and wc, which is why mkdep.py builds `v10dd' as an FSTOOL.
# The probe failed SAFE (it reported no room rather than passing) but its
# diagnosis was wrong, and a synthetic probe built on tools this machine may not
# have is the wrong design however carefully it is written.
#
# So there is no synthetic probe.  The detector is the SURVEY ITSELF: a full
# filesystem makes every remaining unit fail, and twenty consecutive failures is
# something no real distribution of defects produces when 315 of 353 units are
# predicted to compile.  It costs nothing, needs no tool at all, and catches
# every systemic cause rather than just this one -- a full disk, a lost mount, a
# vanished compiler.
#
# Counted with a string and `case' because 1985 sh has no $(( )) and `expr' is
# no more guaranteed present here than dd was.

#
# EVERY EXIT FROM THIS SCRIPT MUST PRINT THE END MARKER, and the first version
# did not.  v10_run sends a command and then waits for the program's own closing
# output, so a script that exits without printing `WORLDC-done' leaves the
# driver blocked for its full 18,000-second timeout -- which is precisely what
# happened: the dd probe failed, this script exited, and a vax750 sat at 100% CPU
# for twenty minutes with no console and nothing to reap it.  CLAUDE.md's rule is
# that a harness must terminate itself and that needing to kill one IS the bug;
# a guest-side script that can exit silently breaks that rule from the inside.
#
# The runaway check further down does not need this, because it lives inside the
# `sed | while' pipeline and therefore in a SUBSHELL -- its exit ends the loop
# and the tallies below still run.  Only a top-level exit can strand the driver.

	# not resolve a QUOTED include for an out-of-tree source there, with -I on
	# the command line and netfsd's trace showing it never looked.
	#
	# IT IS *NOT* WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THIS SURVEY, AND THE RUN THAT TESTED
	# THAT SAID SO.  Thirty-four units failed like this:
	#
	#	/n/v10/src/cmd/f77/data.c: 2: Can't find include file defs
	#	/n/v10/src/cmd/neqn/diacrit.c: 3: Can't find include file e.def
	#
	# and the diagnosis was that cpp could not find them.  It was wrong.
	# Building in-tree changed the message to `./data.c: 2: Can't find
	# include file defs' and nothing else, because `defs' WAS NOT ON THE
	# COURIER DISK: `sources()' collects .c, .h, .s and the generator
	# suffixes, `world_cpio()' copies exactly that, and the tape also writes
	# headers called `defs', `defines', `e.def', `manifest' and `trace.d'.
	# A missing FILE, reported as a compiler defect.  scan() records
	# unit-local includes by name now, whatever they are called, and
	# world.cpio carries them -- forty more files.
	#
	# Two things kept this cheap.  The counter-evidence was already in this
	# project's own kernel build (K7 compiles `streamio.c' out-of-tree with a
	# quoted `"sys/param.h"' and it resolves, every run), so the rule could
	# not simply be "quoted includes ignore -I".  And the comment that stood
	# here said, in as many words, that if the units still failed the
	# diagnosis was wrong and this text had to be corrected rather than the
	# fix defended.  They still failed.  This is that correction.
	#
	# The in-tree build STAYS, on its own merits: it is what the tape's
	# mkfiles do, it is what K15 measured as necessary, and it removes a
	# whole class of question about where a header is looked for.
	#
	# So the unit is copied to local disk and compiled there.  `cp f1 ... fn
	# d' is V10's own (cmd/cp/cp.c: `r |= copy(...)' in a loop), so a
	# directory in the glob fails that one copy and the rest still land --
	# which is why this needs neither `find' nor `cpio', neither of which is
	# on every image this runs against.
	#
	# ONE LEVEL OF SUBDIRECTORY IS ENOUGH, and that is measured: 111 of
	# world.units' source paths carry a `/' and the deepest carries exactly
	# one.  V10's mkdir makes one level, so this would silently copy nothing
