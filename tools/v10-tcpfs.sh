#
# K12.0 proved the client, the protocol library and fmount(2) all work by mounting
# over a PIPE.  This does the same mount on a TCP connection to netfsd, which is
# the server this project has had since the N track -- see tools/v10-tcpfs.exp's
# header for why netafs and not netbfs, and for the three preconditions the N track
# paid for.
