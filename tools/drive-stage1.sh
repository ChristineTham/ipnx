# Patterns below are deliberately UNANCHORED.
#
# The tty echoes typed characters as they arrive and they interleave into
# whatever is printing, so a marker routinely lands mid-line -- the last run
# logged "echC3-CASE-clean" and "echoC3-CLOCK-ok", and every ^-anchored check
# scored them as failures on a run where they had in fact passed.
#
# Unanchored is only safe because the guest spells each marker with a shell
# variable (echo C3-CLOCK$OK), so the echo contains "C3-CLOCK$OK" and the
# output contains "C3-CLOCK-ok"; nothing but the result can match the full
# string.  Do not "simplify" a marker back to a literal.
