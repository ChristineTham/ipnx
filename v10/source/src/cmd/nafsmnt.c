/*
 * nafsmnt -- mount a host directory over TCP with V10's netafs client.
 *
 *	cc -o nafsmnt nafsmnt.c -lin
 *	./nafsmnt 10.0.2.2 9200 /n/host
 *	./nafsmnt -u /n/host
 *
 * ipnx ADDITION, not a patch: see v10/src/PATCHES.md.  Nothing on the tape can
 * do this, and the reason is documented rather than assumed -- netfs/libnetb's
 * `setup' is the shipped mounter and every one of its three transports is
 * Datakit (`ipcopen', `ipcexec', `ipcrexec'), which is the network V10 lost in
 * 1985.  So the tape cannot run as-is and this is the smallest thing that makes
 * it run: a transport it can still have.
 *
 * IT IS A PORT OF THIS PROJECT'S OWN v8/usr/src/cmd/nmount.c, phase N6, and the
 * differences are exactly two system calls:
 *
 *	V8	gmount(RMFSTYP, unique*256, 0, fd, mount)	slot 49
 *	V10	fmount(1, fd, mount, dev)			slot 26
 *
 * THE FOURTH ARGUMENT IS THE DEVICE NUMBER, NOT A FLAG, and the kernel's own
 * parameter name misleads.  `namount(sip, ip, flag, mnt, fstyp)' hands it to
 * nadomount(), which does `pi.i_dev = flag; iget(&pi, flag, ROOTINO)' and builds
 * the root's tag as `(flag<<16)|ROOTINO'.  V8 passed dev as gmount's SECOND
 * argument; V10 moved it to the last.
 *
 *	V8	gmount(RMFSTYP, unique*256, 1, 0, 0)		to unmount
 *	V10	funmount(mount)				slot 50
 *
 * V10 removed gmount -- its slot 49 reads `nosys / was gmount' -- and fmount
 * takes an open FILE DESCRIPTOR, so the CONNECTION is named by the fd while the
 * MOUNT is still named by (fstyp, dev).  V8's zero-minor rule does disappear --
 * sys/neta.c's namount() insisted on it and nadomount() does not -- but the
 * device number itself does not: it is what every request's tag carries.
 *
 * WHY netafs AND NOT netbfs.  V10 carries both clients and ipnx780.m configures
 * four instances of each.  netbfs is the later, portable protocol -- a 24-byte
 * marshalled header, version 2 -- and netafs is V8's, which this project already
 * has a server for: `netfs/' has spoken it since the N track.  The two neta.h
 * headers settle it -- V10's is V8's plus three lines, `NSEARCH 0', `NMKDIR 17'
 * and `NRMDIR 18', with struct senda, struct rcva and the original sixteen
 * opcodes IDENTICAL -- and the filesystem type agrees too: nafs is fstyp 1 in
 * seki's own fstypsw[], which is V8's RMFSTYP.
 *
 * THE TWO THINGS THAT WASTED AN AFTERNOON ON V8 APPLY UNCHANGED, because the
 * inet stack is the same code:
 *
 *   The tcp device minor must be ODD.  tcp_device.c refuses an even minor whose
 *   socket is not already active -- that is the inbound/accept side -- so an
 *   outgoing call on /dev/tcp00 fails with no useful diagnostic.  libin's
 *   tcp_sock() writes `for(n = 01; n < 100; n += 2)' and never says why.
 *
 *   And TCP must have been pushed onto an ip device first (`tcpconfig /dev/ip6
 *   &' on V8).  Without it open() succeeds, the tcpuser write succeeds, and the
 *   connect blocks FOREVER with no diagnostic, because there is nothing
 *   underneath the device.
 *
 * K&R throughout: pcc2 is the compiler and it rejects a prototype outright.
 *
 * ONE INET HEADER, NOT THREE, AND THAT IS NOT TIDINESS.  r70's
 * <sys/inet/tcp.h> has no include guard and <sys/inet/tcp_user.h> includes it
 * itself (`#ifndef KERNEL'), so naming both gives pcc2 the same two typedefs
 * twice -- and the second time round `tcp_port' is already a type name, so
 * `typedef unsigned short tcp_port' reads as three type specifiers combined:
 *
 *	"/usr/include/sys/inet/tcp.h":3:illegal type combination
 *	"/usr/include/sys/inet/tcp.h":5:illegal type combination
 *
 * Two errors pointing at Bell Labs' header and none at the file that caused
 * them.  <sys/inet/in.h> escaped only because its first line happens to be
 * `#ifndef INADDR_ANY'.  The tape's own answer is ipc/libin/tcp_lib.c, which
 * includes <sys/inet/tcp_user.h> and nothing else; <sys/types.h> stays because
 * <sys/neta.h> uses time_t and includes nothing.
